Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft client, and, by extension, Microsoft account.\n\n**As of 1.19.1, it also disables Player Chat Reporting**\n\nPlease notice that, while I am aware of [Guardian](https://github.com/nodusclient/guardian) and certain other exploits that allow you to counteract reporting systems on the client against the will of the server, I am consciously choosing to not integrate them as part of this mod. No Chat Reports will only remain effective on the client side if the server allows it to be. If you do not like servers that enforce chat signing and fully support chat reporting - I advise to simply not play on them.\n\nAlso, while there are many plugins out there that \"borrow\" the name and even icon of NoChatReports, please be aware that **I have not authored any of them** and cannot say how well they do their job.\n\n## Installation and Usage:\n\nNoChatReports supports both Fabric and Forge, just download the version for your respective modloader and game version. It can be installed on either the client, server, or on both sides, and will function differently depending on which sides it is present on:\n\n**1. Only Client:** The client will refuse to send the account's public key to the server, and signatures will be stripped from the messages that you send. This way it won't be useful to try and report your messages, as there will be no proof that they were actually sent from your account. The server will relay them unless the `enforce-secure-profile` option is set to `true` in the `server.properties` file (which it is by default since 1.19.1)\n\nIf the server does require you to sign messages and you are on either 1.19.1 or 1.19.2, you will not be able to join the server unless you agree to send signed messages (NoChatReports will supply a warning screen), if you are on 1.19.3 or higher, you will still be able to join the server, but will not be able to use chat-related commands (other commands do still work)\n\n**2. Only Server:** Clients will still attach signatures when sending messages to the server, but the server will strip them before relaying them to other players. This way chat reporting will not work for any players that join. You can enable the conversion of player to system messages in the config, to prevent players without the mod from seeing them as \"Not Secure\"\n\nAs of 1.20.2 the server cannot disable the \"unsigned messages\" warning on the client. It can only be disabled if the client has NoChatReports (or a similar mod) installed.\n\n**3. Both Client and Server:** Signatures will be stripped on the client side before sending messages to the server, which will not attempt to verify message signatures. Chat reporting and \"Only Show Secure Chat\" will not function, and players will be notified that those features are disabled by the mod when trying to use them.\n\nAlthough NoChatReports can function when it is only present on one of either sides, NoChatReports can be configured to demand itself to be installed on the respective other side in order to play. This way you can install it on the server and require all clients that join to have NoChatReports installed, but you can also leave it server-only if you prefer.\n\nAdditionally, if installed on the client, NoChatReports will disable Telemetry (similar to what [No Telemetry](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-telemetry) does).\n\nTo make sure that your server is compatible with NoChatReports, you can take a look at [this part of the wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players).\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe configuration files are located in the `NoChatReports` subfolder of the default config folder.\n\n`NCR-Client.json` stores Client-Side settings\n\n`NCR-Common.json` stores Server-Side settings\n\n`NCR-Encryption.json` stores Chat Encryption settings (Only effective on the client)\n\n`NCR-ServerPreferences.json` stores Per-Server Signing Modes\n\nYou can find more information [here](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/).\n\n## Chat Encryption\nI have put together a video dedicated to Chat Encryption, watching it will help you to learn how it is used (and whether you should): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7RzNP32k-s\n\n## Documentation:\nYou can find documentation and other information relevant to this mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/). It currently features the following articles:\n- [Configuration Files](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Configuration-Files/)\n- [Protecting Server Players](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/Protecting-Server-Players/)\n- [How to Get Safe Server Status](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status)\n- [I Got Banned!](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/I-Got-Banned)\n- [To Encrypt or Not to Encrypt](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/To-Encrypt-or-Not-To-Encrypt)\n- [The Realms Question](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question)\n\n\n## For Developers:\nIf you develop your own mod, plugin or other server software that in some way prevents chat reports, you can make clients with No Chat Reports installed recognize servers running your software as safe. I wrote [a small article](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/How-to-Get-Safe-Server-Status) about this. For clarification or further inquiries - contact me via Discord, link in \"External resources\".\n\n## Reasoning:\nSee my videos for an explanation of how message signatures and chat reporting work in the game, their failures and the reasoning behind the creation of this mod:\n1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYAUEMlugyw\n2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DobmW1ZUcbQ\n3.

If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/raw/master/.github/README-assets/options.png\" alt=\"Options\" width=\"450\">\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your

mods which simply add buffs/debuffs after waking up should work.

The speed of the night scales linearly for each player that's sleeping at the same time.\n\n- Q: Does only the server need this mod or does the client need it too?  \nA: Only the server needs this mod (but it works on the client too if you're going to host LAN or play singleplayer). There's optional clientside support for the cloud speed multiplier.\n\n- Q: Can you still avoid rain/thunder by sleeping?  \nA: Yes. After sleeping until dawn the weather will become clear. I might make this configurable in the future, let me know if you want this.\n\n- Q: Does this mod speed up things like furnaces, redstone, the raid timer, and other (modded) block entities?  \nA: Yes!\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under LGPLv2.1, see

margin is added before the following Markdown -->\n </p>\n</center>\n\nSodium is a powerful rendering engine and optimization mod for Minecraft 1.16+ which greatly improves performance and graphical quality. It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues. Make sure you include information about the mods you are using, and attach any crash/log files you have.\n\n# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWe have a short wiki with some of the most frequently asked questions [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/caffeine-meta/wiki/FAQ). More likely than not, your question already has an answer here.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.

It has support for configuring a custom block-replace list, for telling the mod what blocks to use to replace a previously broken one, allowing for balancing and preventing potential abuse of this mod.\n\n## Features\n\n### Explosion healing modes\n\nSpecial modes that customize the way explosions are healed even further:\n\n- **Daytime Healing Mode**: Makes explosions wait until sunrise to begin healing. When they do, they will need a source of light to be able to heal.\n- **Difficulty-based Healing Mode**: Speeds up or slows down the healing of explosions depending on the difficulty of the world or server.\n- **Blast-resistance based Healing Mode**: Blocks with a higher blast resistance will take longer to heal. Their delays will also receive a randomized offset, causing blocks to heal in bursts.\n\nBlocks will be healed during the explosion healing process. A block may be healed at a position if a player would also be able to place a block at that position.\n\n### Different explosion sources\n\nThis mod also supports healing explosions of different sources, such as Ghasts and Withers. By default, the mod will only heal Creeper explosions, but you can toggle each explosion source individually.\n\n### Make explosions not drop items\n\nYou can individually configure whether explosions coming from different sources should drop their items. By default, all explosion source types are allowed to drop their items, but you can configure these settings individually via the config file or via commands.\n\n### Configurable delays\n\nConfigure the amount of time it takes for an explosion to start healing, and the amount of time between each block placement.\nKeep in mind that some explosion modes will use their own values for the explosion heal and block placement delays.\n\n- **Warning**: Both delays have a minimum value of 0.05 seconds. Attempting to force a lower value by setting it manually in the config will make the mod use the default values instead.\n\n### Restore the NBT data of block entities\n\nToggle the restoration of block NBT data when healing the block. You can also optionally force this block to always heal to guarantee the original block along with its nbt data is always healed\n\n### Make falling blocks not fall\n\nYou can make blocks such as sand and gravel remain in place when healed. These will only fall when receiving a neighbor update.\n\n### Whitelist\n\nYou can configure an optional whitelist that allows you to specify the blocks that are allowed to heal in an explosion. To do this, you can open the mod's configuration file, and find the following section:\n\n```toml\n#Use an optional whitelist to customize which blocks are allowed to heal. To add an entry, specify the block's namespace\n#along with its identifier, separated by a colon, and add it in-between the square brackets below. Separate each entry with a comma.\n#Example entries:\n#whitelist_entries = [\"minecraft:grass\",  \"minecraft:stone\", \"minecraft:sand\"]\n[whitelist]\n\twhitelist_entries = [\"minecraft:placeholder\"]\n```\n\nTo add entries to the whitelist, you can add a string containing the block's namespace and identifier separated by a colon to the array, like shown in the example above. Separate each entry with a comma.\nYou can also find a preference setting named \"enable_whitelist\" to enable or disable the usage of the whitelist.\n\n### Replace map\n\nIn the mod's config file, you can customize a \"replace map\". This is used if you would like a certain block to be healed with another one, instead of using the same block. If a block is healed with another one, the properties of the original block will be carried over to the new block, preserving properties like the block's orientation.\n\nTo add entries to the replace map, you can open the configuration file (located in your config folder and named `creeper-healing.toml`), scroll down and add entries below the `[replace_map]` section, using the following format, and separating each entry by skipping a line:\n\n```toml\n\"minecraft:name_of_old_block\" = \"minecraft:name_of_new_block\"\n```\n\nBy default, the mod includes the following entry in the replace map:\n\n```toml\n\"minecraft:diamond_block\" = \"minecraft:stone\"\n```\n\n- **Warning**: Do not set the same block to be replaced with multiple blocks, as this will cause a crash upon game startup. That is, do not use the same key twice or more in the replace map.\n\n### Extra settings\n\nYou can also find settings to toggle extra features, such as:\n\n- Enable or disable the block placement sound effect when a block is healed.\n- Heal explosions faster via splash potions of Healing or Regeneration.\n\n### Commands\n\nAll of the mod's settings can also be modified in-game via commands. Access all of them via the `/creeper-healing` parent command. The config file also supports being reloaded in-game via `/creeper-healing reload_config` to avoid having to restart the server or world. Note that all commands require operator permission.\n\n## Configuration  File\nWhen the server or game is started, the mod will look for an existing `creeper-healing.toml` file for the config folder of your game. If it exists, it will read the values from there. If not, it will create a new config file in `/config/creeper-healing.toml`. You can then edit this file to configure the mod, and restart the server or game to apply the changes, or use the `/creeper-healing reload_config` in-game command.\n\nThe following is the default configuration file generated upon first mod initialization or whenever the mod fails to find the config file during server or world shutdown.\n\n```toml\n#Configure the delays related to the healing of explosions.\n[delays]\n#(Default = 3.0) How much time in seconds should an explosion wait for to begin healing.\nexplosion_heal_delay = 3.0\n#(Default = 1.0) The time in seconds that a block takes to heal.\nblock_placement_delay = 1.0\n\n#Toggle whether certain explosion should drop items.

All of these changes are at the code level and will not change how you currently use the configuration system. Furthermore, the following features and changes have been made:\n\n- Added three new preference settings:\n  - `restore_block_nbt`: This new setting will save the block's NBT data (such as inventories) and subsequently restore it upon healing. When a block with NBT data is destroyed by an explosion and it is to be healed, the block itself (such as the chest or furnace) will not drop as an item, so as to avoid duplication of the chest. This does not necessarily mean that surrounding blocks won't drop their items when exploded. This option is disabled by default.\n  - `force_blocks_with_nbt_to_always_heal`: This setting makes it so that blocks with NBT data destroyed from explosions that will be healed always heal, regardless of whether this block is mapped to another block in the replace map, or whether there is a block at the position where the block with NBT will try to be healed at. This option should be enabled alongside `restore_block_nbt` to ensure that inventories of blocks  like chests always end up restored. This option is disabled by default.\n  - `make_falling_blocks_fall`: This setting makes it so that blocks affected by gravity do not fall upon being healed, unless triggered by a neighbor update, which can include the healing of blocks adjacent to the gravity affected block.\n- The serialization of explosions will now use compressed JSON instead of regular JSON.\n- Updated the Fabric Loader dependency to 0.15.10.\n- An internal, non user-modifiable list of excluded blocks has been hard-coded into the mod's mechanics to exclude certain blocks from being affected by the mechanics of this mod. As of the release of this update, it only includes Shulker Boxes, This is because shulker boxes always drop their item with the inventory contained within it, making the restoration of Shulker boxes unnecessary. Furthermore, attempting to integrate them proved to be troubling due to their unique behavior regarding the dropping of items when destroyed.\n- Corresponding commands to edit the newly added preference settings have been added.\n- Made it so that, if an explosion cannot be healed, then force all blocks affected by that explosion to drop their items, regardless of the user defined settings.\n\n\nPlease make sure to **report** any issues or make suggestions in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ArkoSammy12/creeper-healing/issues) or in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/UKr8n3b3ze).","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-01T05:28:59.668377Z","downloads":1775,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"d4de2aabcda2551c64c4296cc18cfcc5b08befe12b934eb8fb2c3b044fa677a85448f93126bb0353fa33fac875a5ff21aeee35f537500b2316932fd88e52a7e1","sha1":"159a47e03ed3e5e29f21c7f3d8186689d1f5b324"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/umAqxZ6n/versions/sFtPjCsN/creeper-healing-1.0.0-1.20.jar","filename":"creeper-healing-1.0.0-1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":471700,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"BrlFrZ3J","user":{"id":"bX4hwBWD","username":"swanslab","name":"swanslab","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/bX4hwBWD/7fe59aab5dfb3c4ada997895464d492723334789.png","bio":"So, is it Swan's Lab or Swan Slab anyway...?\n(Also known as Memokii.)","created":"2024-04-10T06:13:09.819303Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"BrlFrZ3J","user":{"id":"axS6hZz3","username":"ArkoSammy12","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/121594394?v=4","bio":"Pixelated typing monkey.\nBored and anxious.\n","created":"2023-01-08T23:33:45.040614Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"creeper-healing-1.0.0-1.20.jar"},"mods\\PresenceFootsteps-1.9.4+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"6319ed83c15b3a178ba7a2e43e1b8aff09efbf33e0e2807745ecf6ed72ac993d9bd560295b2623f79cbc4c06fb5cb09066cf108cb053f3c40608bb5dc93307c4","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"rcTfTZr3","slug":"presence-footsteps","project_type":"mod","team":"GvrerX1T","title":"Presence Footsteps","description":"..An Overly complicated Sound Mod...","body":"# Presence-Footsteps\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/actions/workflows/gradle-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MineLittlePony/Kirin/actions/workflows/gradle-build.yml)\n[![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps)](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/releases/latest)\n![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps)\n![](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-fabric-orange.svg)\n\n_..An Overly complicated Sound Mod..._\n\n---\n\nThis is the continuation of Huricaaan (Ha3)'s original mod, maintained and updated to the latest version of Minecraft. All previous features have been restored and some new ones added, with new development promised for the future on the opensource github profile!\n\n---\n\nExpect to see a more rich and immersive Minecraft world, one where Presence Footsteps adds new and more dynamic sounds for every block the player walks on. Every block has its own material assigned to it, and can make their own, customized sounds to better match what they're made of.\n\n---\n\n- Wooden chests are creaky and old,\n- stone is dusty and rough.\n- Piston heads sound like wood, whilst their bodies are stone,\n- even cake sounds like you might destroy if you step in the frosting!\n- Tall grass and bristles make a dry, rustling sound as you step through them,\n- Magma sounds like it's literally cooking your souls!\n\n---\n\nNot only that, but the latest version includes step sounds for certain non-block entities:\n\n---\n\nShulkers make the same creaky box noises as Shulker boxes, boats sound like wood, and armour stands creak and produce a stone stepping sound as you walk on their stone slab base.\n\n ---\n\n## Sound Packs\n\nPresence Footsteps is **fully customisable** with resource packs. The mod by default includes a pack with its own sounds\nand material mappings for the vanilla blocks, however if you don't like those sounds or want to use your own, this pack can be turned off\nor used together with packs from the community.\n\nNote that you need **at least one** sounds pack enabled for the mod to function.\n\n![image](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/assets/6429283/9c50aa59-0f59-4324-aab7-cb360acac2ad)\n\n## Mod Support\n\nPresence Footsteps will attempt to figure out the sounds of modded blocks by looking at the vanilla material/sound types they use.\nIf your mod is using very unique sounds though, you can add mappings to your mod to directly control what sounds presence footsteps uses for your block by\nfollowing the [guide on our wiki](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/wiki/Information-for-Resourcepack-Creators)\n","published":"2020-12-30T13:18:36.966588Z","updated":"2024-06-10T21:24:56.880523Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3436930,"followers":2934,"categories":["decoration"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.7.10","1.8.9","1.9.4","1.10","1.16.1","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17-rc1","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","23w51a","23w51b","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21-rc1","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","liteloader","quilt"],"versions":["BEtLdX9C","wl2DCPmO","iu4qJBKh","U0g0vHwf","r0Hz3hFo","3R7j6E4Z","20NGWQNM","2Dcs7kJq","cXdGDBED","HSI3wnPT","31QS6G6Z","gLDVmoRt","IUc6dyrf","9ZPyiU8N","3fEb2K4u","GExGOzbi","M7mmrOFn","M7xLhDyx","jxsFtML2","FMF3yzCR","KrTss88l","pOCYcZUF","giebTOyU","teGodXxG","Vt7ls0pO","3JQQCViD","douonZQK","WswrXhsm","LIWEWgbC","KAmTaDGR","EvZkNyaK","ji7wRvVK","HwGHderf","LjDXTyEn","skZ5rNJe","HcfMgmXT","378nQU71","4CjXUG8M"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rcTfTZr3/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"LjDXTyEn","project_id":"rcTfTZr3","author_id":"8a7Nm6u3","featured":true,"name":"Presence Footsteps 1.9.4+1.20.1","version_number":"1.9.4+1.20.1","changelog":"[Changelog](https://github.com/Sollace/Presence-Footsteps/releases/tag/1.9.4%2B1.20.5)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-15T19:08:02.030024Z","downloads":221169,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"6319ed83c15b3a178ba7a2e43e1b8aff09efbf33e0e2807745ecf6ed72ac993d9bd560295b2623f79cbc4c06fb5cb09066cf108cb053f3c40608bb5dc93307c4","sha1":"f4b446c7153bf6dbe41b7f3325686e3dd630dff1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rcTfTZr3/versions/LjDXTyEn/PresenceFootsteps-1.9.4%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"PresenceFootsteps-1.9.4+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":5733027,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"JBjInUXM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"GvrerX1T","user":{"id":"8a7Nm6u3","username":"Sollace","name":"­Sollace","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6429283?v=4","bio":"­","created":"2020-12-01T08:11:42.703275Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"PresenceFootsteps-1.9.4+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26.jar":{"sha512":"d0faf200dda358efddad2d2809f646023f4dd06254572369e07f3bf33cb6941f0fcdb02db4675b30b4f3bd542cbf6196e135680ba91a2b74c2b071f34978e2d5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"aC3cM3Vq","slug":"mouse-tweaks","project_type":"mod","team":"Gn6mAc1d","title":"Mouse Tweaks","description":"Enhances inventory management by adding various functions to the mouse buttons. ","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2024-06-17T08:24:45.317893Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2666735,"followers":2168,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader","neoforge"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR","LABx1dmK","mjuG4AYd","LG14xw1O","7nm8NrSL","1n3YehcE","nWbxhour","7JVXOe3K","GUHZDxpy","9IcJV4UJ","dUVBjrNs","ylmBQ38A"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"mjuG4AYd","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.20–1.20.4 Fabric] Mouse Tweaks 2.26","version_number":"1.20-2.26-fabric","changelog":"- Improved compatibility with slots with custom stack limits (like in the Nether Chested mod).","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-02T16:59:36.217330Z","downloads":446376,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"d0faf200dda358efddad2d2809f646023f4dd06254572369e07f3bf33cb6941f0fcdb02db4675b30b4f3bd542cbf6196e135680ba91a2b74c2b071f34978e2d5","sha1":"6a6b977e671b1ab625e740fc70fb5300c21bb841"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/mjuG4AYd/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26.jar","primary":true,"size":77943,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"42f757f20c9437f93aa9aa912519231db91e961c","sha512":"92e908a8ac714509904a6b484a24c68a43569a28a4a2800d9ea1144c8de9476363707e40c7eb3739712a0c94312b244f014f8114ca83b668b55a4b7164f56abf"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/mjuG4AYd/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26-sources.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":65765,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gn6mAc1d","user":{"id":"On32SQVu","username":"YaLTeR","name":"Ivan Molodetskikh","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794388?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-20T15:35:29.504966Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.20-2.26.jar"},"mods\\CutThrough-v8.0.2-1.20.1-Fabric.jar":{"sha512":"ca1c67d7c948b6832480877d1d2483a1f5b9d29fe55963bcbbecd59f22b8546e377d1a8b85b38557a95cb0a2de2be90ef9beeb1dc3d510f1679124ec49b90f0f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Dk6su9JN","slug":"cut-through","project_type":"mod","team":"Dzaa5u54","title":"Cut Through","description":"Cleanly swing through transparent blocks like tall grass to hit mobs without breaking said block.","body":"<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/cutthrough/banner.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"240\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/cutthrough/strip.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;

Additionally Cut Through is extremly efficient with a negligible amount of additional calculations over vanilla compared to similar mods and works great with many other mods that rely on Minecraft's hit target implementation.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/cutthrough/strip.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/commons/headers/media.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"32\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/cutthrough/media/1.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/cutthrough/strip.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/commons/headers/installation.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"32\" /></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">⏩ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">INSTALLATION REQUIRED ON CLIENT &amp; REQUIRED ON SERVER</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">⏩ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">REQUIRES </span></strong><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzles-lib\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">PUZZLES LIB</span></strong></a><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> TO BE INSTALLED (FABRIC &amp; NEOFORGE &amp; FORGE)</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">⏩ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">REQUIRES </span></strong><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">FABRIC API</span></strong></a><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> TO BE INSTALLED (FABRIC)</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">⏩ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">REQUIRES </span></strong><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/forge-config-api-port\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">FORGE CONFIG API PORT</span></strong></a><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> TO BE INSTALLED (FABRIC &amp; FORGE)</span></strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/cutthrough/strip.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/commons/headers/configuration.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"32\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Configuration is easily possible directly from in-game using the mod menu (requires </span><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Mod Menu</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> by </span><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/user/Prospector\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Prospector</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> to be installed on Fabric) by installing </span><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Forge Config Screens</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">For manual configuration using an external text editor all files are found at </span><code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">.minecraft/config</span></code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">, named as </span><code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">MOD_ID-client.toml</span></code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">, </span><code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">MOD_ID-common.toml</span></code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">, or </span><code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">MOD_ID-server.toml</span></code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> depending on the type of config.

The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div

blah\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Rewritten Kotlin DSL\n\nCompletely rewrote the Kotlin DSL!\n\n```kotlin\nYetAnotherConfigLib(\"namespace\") {\n    val category by categories.registering {\n        val option by rootOptions.registering<Int> {\n            controller = slider(range = 5..10)\n            binding(::thisProp, default)\n            \n            val otherOption by

You can find the Forge mod [here.](https://modrinth.com/project/farmers-delight/)\n## This port is only for 1.20.1+, if you want a Fabric port for older Minecraft versions, you can find it [here.](https://modrinth.com/project/farmers-delight-fabric/)\n\n## Have any issues with this port? Refer to us directly on either of these discords instead:\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/qdKRTDf8Cv\"><img src=\"https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/dynamic_badges/blob/master/discord.svg?raw=true\" alt=\"Supplementaries Discord\" width=\"255\" height=\"88\" /></a><a href=\"https://discord.greenhouseteam.dev/\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/J6hJYtZ.png\" alt=\"Greenhouse Discord\" width=\"224\" height=\"96\" /></a>\n\n\n### Oh and as a bonus, for the time being, the mod comes with an extra feature, **Skillet Burger Flipping**. Just press left click when cooking anything on a skillet or use a shovel on a placed down one!\n\n**🌽 Description**\n\n**Farmer's Delight** is a mod that gently expands upon farming and cooking in Minecraft.\n\nUsing a simple cooking system and a few familiar ingredients, you'll be able to prepare a wide variety of hearty meals: from sandwiches to salads and stews, from beautiful desserts to mouth-watering feasts, no ingredient will be left behind in your kitchen!\n\nIt also introduces a rich set of utilities: a way to **improve the very soil** your crops grow in, a brand new kind of tool to **scavenge resources** with, cute **decorations** for your builds, and many blocks and items to help you on your adventure!\n\nIt's time to farm a little bit of everything!\n\n \n**📖 Getting Started**\n\n**Follow the advancements!** Much of its progression is described through them. By default, press the (L) key to open the Advancements screen.\n\nIf you'd rather get a more straight-forward guide, we wrote a [Getting Started](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started) to help you learn the basics!\n\n \n**📝 FAQ**\n<details>\n<summary>Expand for FAQ</summary>\n\n**Q. How does this different from the other existing Farmer's Delight Fabric?**\n\nA. This port's main focus has been on simplicity and faithfulness to the original mod. This meant that only minor changes were made to accommodate the loader specific things.\n\nPackage names and all existing behavior has been kept the same. This means that FD addons can now easily be ported from Forge to Fabric with, ideally, no change at all as all the package names are the same.\n\n[A list of differences can be found here.](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelight/blob/1.20/information/Differences.md)\n\n**Q. Will existing addons work for this?**\n\nA. While porting existing Forge addons to Fabric will be trivial, already existing Fabric addons made for the old Fabric port will NOT work and they will have to update to reflect the new package structure.\n\n[A list of supported addons and integrations can be found here.](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelight/blob/1.20/information/Addons_And_Integrations.md)\n\nFeel free to ask for more compat layers, however, they will only be done if they are simple enough to be able to be done, anything more complicated and you're best to wait for a developer to support Farmer's Delight Refabricated or just accept that they might not, it's really up to them.\n\n**Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?**\n\nA. Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n- Always read the changelogs! Minor and major versions can sometimes have breaking changes, which will be explained there.\n\n**Q. Will I keep old blocks from the other FD port?**\n\nA. The mods use the same IDs so yes.\n\n**Q. Will addons for the other port be updated to use this one instead?**\n\nA. That depends on them. Updating/porting a Forge addon is trivial but this will still take a bit of time and depends on the individual modder. So please be patient and don't harrass modders.\n\n**Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?**\n\nA. Farmer's Delight Refabricated is currently being updated for 1.20+. Any other versions are currently discontinued.\n\n**Q. Are you going to backport this mod to versions before 1.15?**\n\nA. No. This mod will never be backported to older versions. The game's older codebases are entirely different, and usually missing important features this mod depends on.\nPlease, do NOT ask for backports!\n</details>","published":"2024-03-27T01:59:37.106681Z","updated":"2024-07-26T14:13:58.730376Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":333114,"followers":264,"categories":["decoration","equipment","food"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["M8bp9Dk5","J5zT5dIA","UFctor0l","ETe2oDvK","FMhV8TQg","X6fzggyI","QzcIQ62s","pnmeqDCQ","6MKCnUff","Qid8WxOf","Ti8scSIz","5dZdVy3m","mCvHYQFv"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/7vxePowz/26e8448993e9bda4dba92b6e7a1a13d9c4333138.png"},"version":{"id":"mCvHYQFv","project_id":"7vxePowz","author_id":"BU21lLGA","featured":false,"name":"Farmer's Delight Refabricated 2.1.2 -

The easiest place to use it is directly from the menu, however you may want to temporarily disable the `minecraft:music.menu` too!\n\n---\n\n## Images\n\n![Minecraft sound settings screen with a new 'Individual Sounds' button.](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/6841890bb46f177ac59b1c3d548f09946427328c.png)\n<br/>\n![A screen with volume controls for every sound in the game.

Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric.

**backpacks**. The mod is a successor of **[JavierDarkona](https://www.curseforge.com/members/darkona/projects)'s** **Adventure Backpack** and since 1.16 all textures have been completely remade to fit the new style. Furthermore, functionality of backpack has been expanded by various new features. Traveler's Backpack is the [official port](https://i.imgur.com/Su1JySt.png).\n\n![travelers backpack text](https://i.imgur.com/OwJ2twO.png)\n\n[![Discord badge](https://img.shields.io/discord/724696823276503210?color=542c14&amp;labelColor=261509&amp;label=&amp;logo=discord&amp;logoColor=white&amp;style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.gg/f8Nnj5VuFj) [![Github badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Github&amp;color=542c14&amp;labelColor=261509&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;logoColor=white)](https://github.com/Tiviacz1337/Travelers-Backpack) [![Wiki badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Wiki&amp;color=542c14&amp;labelColor=261509&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;logoColor=white)](https://github.com/Tiviacz1337/Travelers-Backpack/wiki)  [![Patreon badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=Support&color=542c14&labelColor=261509&style=for-the-badge&logo=kofi&logoColor=white)](https://ko-fi.com/tiviacz1337) [![Ko-Fi badge](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&amp;message=Become%20My%20Patron&amp;color=542c14&amp;labelColor=261509&amp;style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=patreon&amp;logoColor=white)](https://www.patreon.com/tiviacz1337)\n\n![travelers backpack bar](https://i.imgur.com/xjdqPMI.png)\n\n- **Full inventory? No more!**\n\nUpgraded backpack can provide about **63 inventory slots** and **2 fluid tanks**, each of which can store up to 7 buckets of fluid or even 28 bottles of potion (Now even more, since it's configurable!). All inventory slots and tanks can be accessed via external pipes. The backpack also provides special buttons - **sort**, **quick stack** and **transfer** to seamlessly manage inventory!\n\n- **Tier Upgrades**\n\nBackpack has to be **upgraded** to reach its maximum storage and tank capacity. Upgrading can be done at a **smithing table** by placing a leather in template slot, tier upgrade and a backpack in next slots. Although the backpack can't be directly upgraded to the Netherite tier, it has to be upgraded to all lower tiers first. To reset backpack upgrades and settings, place the backpack on the ground and Shift + Right-click while holding a Blank Upgrade in your hand.\n\n- **Chestplate or backpack? Why not both?**\n\nTraveler's backpack doesn't need any empty armor slot (or other slot, unless Curios/Trinkets integration is enabled) to be worn. The player can wear one backpack on their back at a time and its inventory can be accessed via the **B** (Configurable) button.\n\n- **The best gear for adventures!**\n\nCrafting Table is your bestfriend? Equip your backpack with Crafting Upgrade! Unroll the sleeping bag whenever you want! Don't worry, you won't lose your spawn point! Also it's worth taking advantage of handy tool slots (Tool swapping described on Wiki). The fluid tanks, in combination with Hose Item (Hose functioning described on Wiki) provide good portable fluid storage.\n\n- **Customization that you have never seen!**\n\nChoose your personal style from over 45 custom backpacks, which represent various creatures and blocks. As if that weren't enough, some of them can provide special abilities! 1.16+ versions provide **dyed backpack**. You can combine whichever dyes you want to create a unique look!\n\n![end travelers backpack showcase](https://i.imgur.com/E1YYiRf.png)\n\n## Backpacks and Inventory Preview\n<details>\n<summary>Click</summary>\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8wR8Thg.png\" alt=\"all backpacks showcase\" height=\"650\" width = \"584\"/>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/c9Ojonb.gif\" width=\"584\" height=\"650\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fmjcSej.gif\" width=\"584\" height=\"650\" /></p>\n\n</details>\n\n![bee travelers backpack showcase](https://i.imgur.com/HpldKTS.png)\n\n*** \n\n[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/np93li4.png\" alt=\"kinetic hosting banner\" width=\"800\" height=\"281\"/>](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=102)\n\n## Modpacks\nYou are allowed to use this mod in public/private modpacks.

It brings many new features, and optimizes for the user experience. Outside of the standard Fabric/Quilt API, EMI requires **zero** dependencies, and can be launched with the game simply and easily.\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fRiHVvU7/images/0d3b5b33d0016b21834ce6f3602169f7c48de13f.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fRiHVvU7/images/f3c8b452eae6dde028c37e3a3e3792459468d865.png)\n\n## Runtime JEI Compat\nFor runtime JEI compat, all you need to do is install JEI alongside EMI and they will work together to share recipes. JEI will be hidden.\n\n## What does EMI bring to the table?\n\nOf course EMI comes with every feature you'd come to expect from the outset, viewing recipes, favoriting items, searching, and the like. But what's new that EMI offers?\n\n* A craftable mode for **quickly crafting** any recipes you're able to make, usable by toggle or as a config for empty searches\n* **Recipes** can be **favorited** with items, and also can be used to quickly craft at a button press\n* A **recipe tree** for breaking down the cost of a complex craft, showing you **every step**, how many **base ingredients** you need, and what you'll have leftover\n* A **recipe tree crafting mode**, counting up the materials and steps you need to be complete to finish a task, including **synthetic favorites** in your sidebar you can use to **craft every step** for exactly as much as you need\n* Smart display of **tags**, with translations, models, and tooltips, showing you ingredients at a glance, such as \"Planks\" instead of slowly rotating through every plank in the game.\n* Smart breakdowns of base costs, letting recipe trees automatically break down to base ingredients, and letting you define **your own defaults** as you play\n* **Tooltips** for recipes, tags, and ingredients showing you what will be crafted, and what makes up an ingredient\n* Binds for quick crafting **straight into your inventory or cursor**, one or many at a time, in conjunction with recipes favorites or the craftable mode\n* A **clean** and **modern** API, built from the ground up to be simple, powerful, and suit all of EMI's features\n* **Zero third party dependencies**. EMI only requires standard, first party Fabric/Quilt APIs\n\n\n## What does EMI stand for?\nIt doesn't, it's not an acronym. Or maybe it's an acronym without a meaning? If it makes you more comfortable, you can pick one from the list below, or make your own up.\n\n* Emi Memy Imi\n* Exhaustively Many Items\n* Explicitly Mandated Items\n* Endless Material Information\n* Expounded Minutia Introspection\n* Earnestly Made Imitation\n* Even More Items\n* Eminence, My Inception\n* Emi's Magic Inventory\n* Efficiently Managed Inventory\n* Exploring Modified:

The structures themselves are a bit \nmore detailed than their vanilla counterparts, but they still fit seamlessly \ninto the world. Not only that but many are inspired by real-life buildings or \narchitectural styles, giving them a fresh new feel. There are over 50 structures \nadded by Towns and Towers so far (as of update 1.9), so have fun exploring! And \nremember, it’s not the destination that’s important, but the journey to get \nthere.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=\"#FFE16A\">If you wish to see all \nof the structures our mod adds, take a look at our gallery </font>\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/CCZbqMn\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</h3>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Compatibility</u></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a full list of mods \nthat are currently compatible with Towns and towers, please look\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gE5DvsPwztTtCVi_i6nEOLQM6tm8NU4Q1iCpuqHY2UM/edit\">\nhere</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pack should be \ncompatible with most world generation mods, like Terralith, WWOO, BYG, BoP, \netc., as well as mods that add also add new structures/villages, such as \nRepurposed Structures or ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Villages. However, some \nfeatures from other mods are not currently present, like the guards from \nVillager Guards mod or certain buildings from Farmer's Delight for example. This \nwill be addressed in the future via a series of datapacks, which will implement \nfeatures from those mods into ours.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 align=\"center\"><strong><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></strong></h2>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>1. Is it safe to update Towns and \nTowers to a newer version?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general yes. Just \nnote that sometimes when we update a few things get changed, so there might be a \nbit of console spam. If any serious problems arise because of that, let us know. \nAnd, as always, make backups. Better be safe than sorry.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>2. Is it safe to add \nTowns and Towers to an already existing world?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yep. Just note that the \nnew structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>3. Is this mod for \nForge or Fabric/Quilt?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both. We have a \nuniversal version for both (now three?) mod loaders.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>4. How can I locate the new \nstructures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.18.2: /locate \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.19+: /locate structure \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that some structures have the exclusives tag added \nin front. Those structures cannot be located if you only have T&amp;T installed. You \nalso need to have one of the mods that T&amp;T is paired with. For a full list, \nscroll down below (if I remember to add it...).<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>5. Does Towns and Towers modify \nexisting vanilla structures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of the latest \nupdate, no. Only new structures are added.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>6. What about the \nloot of these structures?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of \nstructures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility (see the \nCompatibility section below for more info), but they also use some custom loot \ntables to better integrate said structures into the world. You will still find \npillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as \nwell as bells, workstations, etc., but also new stuff like food, armor, and \nother goodies.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>7. How can I report \nbugs/issues/suggestions?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write them down below \nin the comments and I’ll try to answer them as soon as possible and as best as \npossible.

Well, wonder no more!\n\nCarry On is a simple mod that improves game interaction by allowing players to pick up, carry, and place single block Tile Entities (such as Chests, Furnaces, Droppers, Spawners, and your favorite machines from other Tech Mods) using only their empty hands. No items (or pickaxes) required. States, meta data, inventory and NBT data are retained. It also allows you to carry around smaller mobs!\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n- Shift (can be rebound) + Right-Click (with Empty Hands) on any Tile Entity or mob to lift and carry\n- Right-Click to place\n\n![Carry On Demo](https://www.creeptech.net/carryon/carryondemo2.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/PJ4Q7tp.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/czlzu1s.gif)\n\n\n**Other features:**\n\n- Works with single block Tile Entities from any mod (yes, tech mods too)\n- Works with all entities (no hostile mobs in survival mode, configurable)\n- Entities can be stacked on each other (only smaller entities on top of larger ones)\n- Respects the ‘lock’ functionality so Tile Entities cannot be stolen\n- Powerful config allows you to blacklist entire mods or specific blocks, and additional customization\n- Players can only carry one Tile Entity or Mob at a time, and are prevented from other actions when carrying\n- Carrying a Tile Entity or Mob slows the player. Items with fuller inventories and larger mobs will cause additional slowness\n- Advanced scripting for modpack creators. Wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Scripting).\n- If you can't place down a picked up block, you can remove it from your inventory with /carryon clear\n- Players can also be carried\n\n**Config Options:**\n\n- Carry On provides a powerful config file, wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Model-Override-Config)\n- Specific blocks or entire mods can be blacklisted\n- An option to carry standard blocks (e.g., Dirt) can be enabled (Default = Off)","published":"2022-12-05T21:45:11.691063Z","updated":"2024-07-17T21:38:57.392120Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1234370,"followers":1005,"categories":["game-mechanics","storage","transportation"],"additional_categories":["utility"],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["WaUwGT7r","aPthYrcV","4taUKxre","ibq5WYnJ","IA7TXsjL","CGK8S9Jc","FS0TPQOn","HMCz7mpi","Tpvzh1n7","CS0T5Zjr","HSrAkWqH","fk6vR3rB","zFYERXVc","F6ZR4jay","QAiSN3Q8","IJ5gr5ow","cE4GdBxS","67jN6bxd","SXmDVLN0","4GE3aVyX","o4LGtvUQ","2jx3bUuL","BycIzhuF","uGbxgawj","LwNYnVxa","NyGIRVfz","1soFLh2H","gq4gg8ZY","fgecxyFN","TNZ4Ah0o","epf47Jaz","f48u7DLZ","i8cp4wxM","u8IQu6NU","TxQzQgUm","tofYc8B0","aKYuUZpd","5QeqM4nf","fg9VeABy","nc5Z9l3C","x5FGVS4q","LTOqV1Cw","iX4EV3eP","9iomDg8D","uemV3oEm","uh2S7w5K","tHTJYcot","e6FYVr4k","6pIQMDen","SgeYUS6n","edGQD16r","Mkla4B3q","AlPBrFTW","CE3MquDi","J7qT9hJD","DjVumdix","EvDx8gEe","8a6KfB5j","b33iu1N6","85jjKm7u","7FcWNYcV","xsWKlT1A","lSa8MVef","v6jFgMGH","2LfOJ5LW"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/d07cc032da5a9854489ab5ae443c91c1147792bc.png"},"version":{"id":"Mkla4B3q","project_id":"joEfVgkn","author_id":"5I09DlLz","featured":false,"name":"Carry On 2.1.2.7","version_number":"2.1.2.7","changelog":"- Fixed Memory Leak\n- Updated default Blacklist\n- Fixed crash with Rats","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-19T22:29:43.157958Z","downloads":568989,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"8f3858977becfbc26f67f4a5579881e15e07d69d","sha512":"ca96f56dba50ea4827ec7a15bc590ccb29aba01896550d3cb398bed18acdf469dd351cdc9312e4743f54955b3162e744c58d76c88eb79b1e5e5b4570f5b33c64"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/versions/Mkla4B3q/carryon-fabric-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar","filename":"carryon-fabric-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar","primary":true,"size":443033,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"4y59IILI","user":{"id":"5I09DlLz","username":"Tschipp","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649893?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-12-05T21:43:38.882316Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"carryon-fabric-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar"},"mods\\YungsBetterWitchHuts-1.20-Fabric-3.0.3.jar":{"sha512":"4182c4b580ac0446968d28561088807a5fc96c4ad792401bf918b2e693f7eb343237f2887d63121469af8a120c4ccc8c84d7add731ea1a45cb429f49092bd6ac","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"t5FRdP87","slug":"yungs-better-witch-huts","project_type":"mod","team":"BqAnU8T5","title":"YUNG's Better Witch Huts","description":"Adds overhauled witch huts to swamps!","body":"<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jDrTFGm.png\" alt=\"YUNG's Better Witch Huts\" width=\"1344\" height=\"416\" /><br />\n<a title=\"Depends on YUNG's API\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-api\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungsapibadge\" alt=\"Depends on YUNG's API\" width=\"211\" height=\"26\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Join the YUNG GANG on Discord!\" href=\"https://discord.gg/rns3beq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungsdiscordbadge2\" alt=\"Join the YUNG GANG on Discord!\" width=\"136\" height=\"28\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Follow me on Twitter!\" href=\"https://twitter.com/yungnickyoung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungstwitterbadge3\" alt=\"Follow me on Twitter!\" width=\"104\" height=\"37\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Subscribe to my YouTube!\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/yungnickyoung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungsyoutubebadge\" alt=\"Subscribe to my YouTube!\" width=\"80\" height=\"30\" /></a>&nbsp;<a title=\"Support me on Patreon!\" href=\"https://patreon.com/yungnickyoung\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://tinyurl.com/yungspatreonbadge\" alt=\"Support me on Patreon!\" width=\"138\" height=\"28\" /></a><br />\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2HNgRET.png\" alt=\"What is this?\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nAn upgrade to witch huts!

It's really weird though that you enter a portal in the overworld, and then when going back through where you came, come out of a different portal in the overworld.

These debuffs include:  \n- Hunger\n- Nausea\n- Blindness\n- Darkness\n- Mining Fatigue\n- Weakness\n- Slowness\n\n## Configuration\nYou can customize the effects of the Sleep Anywhere mod through its configuration file (located in .minecraft/config/sleepanywhere-config): Adjust the duration of debuffs applied when sleeping, or disable them entirely if desired (by setting them to 0).   \n\n## Feedback and Support\nIf you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improving the Sleep Anywhere mod, feel free to reach out via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/BogdanValentin/SleepAnywhere/issues) or leave a message in the comments.\n\n## License\nThis mod is distributed under the [CC0-1.0 License](https://legacy.curseforge.com/project/997547/license).\n","published":"2024-04-03T18:57:16.742685Z","updated":"2024-04-18T21:13:57.217675Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":612,"followers":12,"categories":["adventure","game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["ug5w5Hq7","jAmX2TIq","Ga3jXgKe","A0ohqjDd","sDFiiKxG","4N1LEmwN","4WJTXSDZ","Aog3AwBN","xAGUBBoc","q5qisyd5","yvSHrycu"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LsIU5HKu/c3cfb79a47a596bfb0d7dd369b3fbfd61655190a.png"},"version":{"id":"Aog3AwBN","project_id":"LsIU5HKu","author_id":"x4AwUWkg","featured":false,"name":"Sleep Anywhere 1.1","version_number":"1.1","changelog":"Fixed spectator bug","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-18T21:11:31.623130Z","downloads":207,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"5e93713c660d83aae777df09a5808940e38b6a02f42a47bf746d89a440383ea95bac46d87212d8c354940a8ed1f34ec7f041ddac0d07365e3f004100545ba87e","sha1":"2115addc138f10d87f73f867ad78bef4fd772542"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LsIU5HKu/versions/Aog3AwBN/sleepanywhere-1.1-1.20.1.jar","filename":"sleepanywhere-1.1-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":149565,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"ccKDOlHs","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"s6uy5Klg","user":{"id":"x4AwUWkg","username":"BogdanValentin977","name":"BogdanValentin977","avatar_url":null,"bio":null,"created":"2024-03-16T21:56:31.379334Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"sleepanywhere-1.1-1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\sodium-extra-0.5.4+mc1.20.1-build.115.jar":{"sha512":"ab561186421776d0db506dcbf1a724f80b345be5769ff00aa4327161c79af6e3f353eb65345ce06da30546ffa6b43e1c4a4c41dd246b7e473b131fd727997a85","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"PtjYWJkn","slug":"sodium-extra","project_type":"mod","team":"EfhDgRdO","title":"Sodium Extra","description":"A Sodium addon that adds features that shouldn't be in Sodium.","body":"# What is Sodium Extra?\nSodium Extra aims to bring most of OptiFine's eye-candy options to Sodium; in addition to providing some features such as visual bug fixes and other performance options that are not yet available on Sodium.\n\n# Features\nHere is a basic rundown of what this mod does.\n\n- Animations Settings (Control fire, water, lava, block animations and etc...)\n- Particles Settings (Control all types of particles, including ones from other mods)\n- Details Settings (Control sky, stars, sun/moon, weather, and much more)\n- Render Settings (Control fog, static entities, and other miscellaneous renderings)\n- Extra Settings (Display FPS, coordinates, toast notifications, clouds, and much more)\n\nSee a more detailed explanation of what features are included in Sodium Extra [here](https://github.com/FlashyReese/sodium-extra-fabric/wiki/Features).\n\n# Modpack Permissions\nThis is a free and open-source project; you can include it in your mod pack as long as you provide attribution!\n\n# Common Questions\n- **Do I need Sodium installed for this mod to work?** You will need to download Sodium for this mod to work.\n- **Can I re-host/upload this mod somewhere else?** Yes, as long as you provide the mod source code.

YUNG's Better Desert Temples redesigns vanilla desert temples to be way more exciting, adding a variety of new puzzles, traps, &amp; parkour challenges. And of course, you'll get much better loot than vanilla's desert temples for your troubles!\n</p>\n<p>\nBy default, mining fatigue will be applied to all players in the Better Desert Temple. Once you clear the temple (i.e. kill the pharaoh at the end of the temple), the mining fatigue effect for that temple will be permanently lifted! You can disable this feature in the config. Additionally, you can re-enable vanilla desert temples to spawn alongside Better Desert Temples in the config.\n</p>\n<p>\nCloser look: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TpkTeTeDKJo\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\nAnimated trailer: <br />\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1C5Z0DaOQk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JR6R3uf.png\" alt=\"Compatibility\" width=\"1125\" height=\"59\" /><br />\nYUNG's Better Desert Temples is intended to be fully compatible with every worldgen mod, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Mineshafts\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-mineshafts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Mineshafts</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Strongholds\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-strongholds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Strongholds</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Better Dungeons\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-better-dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Better Dungeons</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Extras\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-extras\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Extras</a></li>\n<li><a title=\"YUNG's Bridges\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/yungs-bridges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YUNG's Bridges</a></li>\n<li>Repurposed Structures.

Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily.

usage optimizations","body":"This mod reduces the memory usage of Minecraft in a few different ways. A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2024-06-16T09:45:34.688950Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":8723755,"followers":5861,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9","agJm6Vrw","PPnbi6JY","HWBrlwWv","i9RcCdZv","7slRrLO6","BkJB5PPB","wmIZ4wP4"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"unerR5MN","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.1 (Fabric/Quilt)","version_number":"6.0.1","changelog":"- Fix performance issue in quad deduplication in some corner cases\n- Slightly improve memory usage for blocks with only one state","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T13:39:15.937801Z","downloads":2512887,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"9b7dc686bfa7937815d88c7bbc6908857cd6646b05e7a96ddbdcada328a385bd4ba056532cd1d7df9d2d7f4265fd48bd49ff683f217f6d4e817177b87f6bc457","sha1":"8fa3b84fc5860dbc30fdf8cced02af68dffcf3fa"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/unerR5MN/ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":125197,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar"},"mods\\owo-lib-0.11.2+1.20.jar":{"sha512":"807e4a3daf493e92c5ff0d5657efbba2a4e0cd2a9b753f2d6f153422629415f189345842a6dd258c87d4c02ebf38950a517bcd8a7ed929af6ed6485ae46cf77e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ccKDOlHs","slug":"owo-lib","project_type":"mod","team":"SH3qQlP1","title":"oωo (owo-lib)","description":"A general utility, GUI and config library for modding on Fabric and Quilt","body":"![Header](https://i.imgur.com/dal6rrf.png)\nA general utility, GUI and config library for modding on Fabric and Quilt\n \n***\n\nFeatures include:\n\n - [owo-ui](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/ui/), a fully-featured declarative UI library for building dynamic, beautiful screens with blazingly fast development times\n\n - [owo-config](https://docs.wispforest.io/owo/config/), a built-in, customizable configuration system built on top of owo-ui.

Slot groups are collections of slots for a certain body part or more vague area. By default there are 6 slot groups (head, chest, legs, feet, offhand, hand) that can have slots added to them, but more groups can be added if desired. Trinkets' UI is intuitive to use, accessible, and attempts to do away with clutter. Its system means that you'll never have a slot that's not used for anything, as mods request the slots they want.\n\nFor basic tutorials and comprehensive documentation, visit this project's [wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Home).\n","published":"2021-06-08T00:05:32.472592Z","updated":"2024-07-15T11:03:13.629144Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1872448,"followers":1227,"categories":["equipment","library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17-rc2","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["70Ajg5iP","dRgbv7A2","29Jd2Dm4","qpiOPBB9","R2UW6ejS","FdJA5sbK","DtvgyMK2","vOuy3Z5S","XqLNMi9J","WiXqMygm","oLUBJhyv","9qrmAiwv","OLwsMJv4","5zEAvqnX","A5kxdEY3","z8ProfKL","e563ycts","tJ23Vcff","AHxQGtuC","7aQD4OG8","SGjPO8H9","JagCscwi"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"AHxQGtuC","project_id":"5aaWibi9","author_id":"R6WsWKy9","featured":false,"name":"Trinkets 3.7.2","version_number":"3.7.2","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-11T04:25:11.224830Z","downloads":491957,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"bedf97c87c5e556416410267108ad358b32806448be24ef8ae1a79ac63b78b48b9c851c00c845b8aedfc7805601385420716b9e65326fdab21340e8ba3cc4274","sha1":"d58cc8759587f03f320f188972ca66baa788d008"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/versions/AHxQGtuC/trinkets-3.7.2.jar","filename":"trinkets-3.7.2.jar","primary":true,"size":238532,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"F0xlmrbH","user":{"id":"R6WsWKy9","username":"Emi","name":"Emi","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/14813658?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-10-26T21:52:52.726926Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"trinkets-3.7.2.jar"},"mods\\EMIEnchants-fabric-1.19.3-1.20.4-1.0.0.jar":{"sha512":"026fc462b1d0adcb8926f6ffe31ce05747ab7e3bec9ff62969c2ca7ac48e4643cb288d55ff094040a0da9db9ee1af461a86213728c2dc450bc3cfe0992667fa4","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"11hKNQb2","slug":"emienchants","project_type":"mod","team":"krNu0eut","title":"EMI Enchants","description":"EMI addon to view enchanting information & enchantment description","body":"![](https://github.com/Mephodio/EmiEnchants/raw/master/media/demo.gif)\n\n[EMI](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) addon to view enchantment information.\n\n* Displays:\n  * Enchantment name, mod, max level\n  * Category and list of items it can be applied to\n  * Rarity, weight, cost per level (see [wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enchantment_weight))\n  * List of conflicting enchantments\n  * Whether the enchantment can be obtained from enchanting table\n  * Whether it can be bought from villager\n  * Whether it can be obtained from various loot sources (chests, fishing, mob equipment drops)\n  * Whether it considered a treasure (villagers sell it at x2 price)\n  * Wheter it's a curse\n  * Description, if provided by mod or resource pack.

(but not really)™ for Blay's multiplatform mods. This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at

Extras\n\nAn addon for Fabric Seasons that adds custom blocks and items to make your experience better.\n\n</center>\n\n### Description\n\nFabric Seasons doesn't add any items or blocks by itself, so if you want a complete experience you'll need this mod.\n\nIf you want **detailed** in-game **help** about the mod and its **additions** I strongly recommend installing the [Patchouli](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/patchouli-fabric) mod.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/KYJrtUI.png\">\n</center>\n\n### Greenhouses\n\nTo **deal** with the seasonal **impact** on crop growth Fabric Seasons: Extras adds 4 blocks that can be used to build fully functional **greenhouses**, with their own **microclimates**, that allow you to **optimize** crop growth **speed** in any season.\n\nThe blocks are:\n- Greenhouse Glass - **Passive block** that creates a **warmer** microclimate\n- Tinted Greenhouse Glass - **Passive block** that creates a **colder** microclimate\n- Crop Heater - **Active machine** that can create a **warmer** microclimate with up to **3 levels**\n- Crop Chiller - **Active machine** that can create a **colder** microclimate with up to **3 levels**\n\nTo **assist** you while building your greenhouses, you can craft the **Crop Season Tester**. An item that **scans** the right-clicked **block** and shows what season is currently affecting it.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\nApart from the greenhouse resources, Fabric Seasons: Extras adds **other blocks** such as:\n- Season Detector - **Redstone component** that outputs a redstone **signal** based on the **current season** and the block's configuration.\n- Season Calendar - Helpful **item/black** that can show you the season **progress** and how many **days** are left until the next season.\n\n### Other Information\n\nFor bug reporting please proceed to the mod's GitHub repository: [https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons-extras](https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons-extras)\n\nIf you have any other questions or suggestions, feel free to call me on Discord @D4rk#0693  \nYou can find me in the Cafeteria Development guild.\n\n[![](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/707435077679841350/embed.png?style=banner2&v=2)](https://discord.com/invite/G4PjhEf)","published":"2023-03-20T08:00:37.047111Z","updated":"2023-06-09T21:57:30.712411Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":671251,"followers":211,"categories":["technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["ZsIzAEfK","XR4aiIK6","Hz4mjAwN","3zXY1Mv9","mHzvDy67","QtDFoiGb","K6nEBM2o","NSa0G7u9","ncdVTDpt","j9GoL3Wu","H6OLpHJp"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/64FYdx5z/472d8a2341cb8f65588420019a7667008cc90e33.png"},"version":{"id":"H6OLpHJp","project_id":"64FYdx5z","author_id":"TPRVvJKm","featured":false,"name":"Fabric Seasons Extras 1.2-BETA","version_number":"1.2-BETA+1.20","changelog":"A changelog can be found at https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons-extras/commits/","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-09T21:57:31.465761Z","downloads":555534,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"fcbb318906832b9d919dd64b023118889290fbd9","sha512":"ebe526d2f0b64029611de50ac47d709d0eff23b1ebb4d5dfae60738dec5f39126b4982f61d0c0607e2cdaf353d01eb2fe4faf1b23babc7477c6be1df60b3916a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/64FYdx5z/versions/H6OLpHJp/fabric-seasons-extras-1.2-BETA%2B1.20.jar","filename":"fabric-seasons-extras-1.2-BETA+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":273134,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"dJtxMqxE","project_id":"KJe6y9Eu","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"ASWTUSvb","user":{"id":"TPRVvJKm","username":"D4rkness_King","name":"Luca Argolo","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/TPRVvJKm/icon.png","bio":"","created":"2020-12-01T01:52:35.107689Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"fabric-seasons-extras-1.2-BETA+1.20.jar"},"mods\\entity_model_features_fabric_1.20.1-2.1.3.jar":{"sha512":"31820ac89d75c433e9a340c3ee1cc793be4a97a418d9b73a8cc3fcbf6f8e077472e47db2a63092981c80e4200a74f1a21f4c36acf38ecd5b9b8b6036e6b99d5e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"4I1XuqiY","slug":"entity-model-features","project_type":"mod","team":"fXLgMy6f","title":"[EMF] Entity Model Features","description":"EMF is an, OptiFine format, Custom Entity Model replacement mod available for Fabric and Forge.","body":"<div align=\"center\">\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/master/fabric/src/main/resources/icon.png\" alt=\"EMF icon\" width=200>\n\n# Entity Model Features\n \n[![Modrinth downloads](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/entity-model-features?color=00AF5C&label=downloads&style=round&logo=modrinth)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features)\n[![CurseForge downloads](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_844662_downloads.svg)](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/entity-model-features)\n\n[![Enviroment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Enviroment-Client-purple)](https://modrinth.com/mods?e=client)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/950942125225283634?color=blue&logo=discord&label=Discord)](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz)\n\n[![Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/traben)\n\nEntity Model Features (EMF) is a Fabric, Quilt & Forge mod that adds support for OptiFine's Custom Entity Models (CEM).<br />It's designed for anyone who wants to use the CEM resource pack features but to use mods such as Sodium, Continuity or ETF.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/49f5b98dfef5b073a3971750673d343e1f92efe5.png\" alt=\"EMF in use\" width=550>\n\n</div>\n\n## Required Mods\nPlease also install the below mods if you can, the obvious ones such as Sodium are not mentioned.\n\nIt should also go without saying EMF is NOT compatible with dorianpb's CEM and OptiFabric.\n#### Required\n- [Entity Texture Features (ETF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures): \n  EMF uses several features from my other mod ETF, so it is required. (primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling.

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes. Please try Sodium (on Fabric) or Embeddium (on Forge) instead!\nUsing OptiFine with ModernFix is not officially supported, and may cause issues.\n\n## 🖥️ Need a server?

This mod is designed primarily for low-end devices.\nThere's [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXWdDoVU1C4) through.\n\n**Q**: Which mod loaders are supported?  \n**A**: Forge, Fabric, Quilt, NeoForge, Legacy Fabric, Ornithe (for both Fabric and Quilt).\n\n**Q**: Which versions are supported?  \n**A**: Minecraft 1.8 or newer.

No guarantee though. At least it should not break your worlds, you just won't be able to load them\nwith this mod and can uninstall it to load otherwise.\n\n**Q**: Is this mod client-side or server-side?  \n**A**: This mod works on logical server side. That is, it HAS effect in singleplayer and\non a dedicated (standalone) server. It has NO effect on the client when playing in multiplayer.\nYou can install it into your client or your server without any requirements for it to be installed on the other side.\n\n**Q**: How to force-load chunks for ticking if spawn chunks have been removed?  \n**A**: If you really need ticking chunks, load individual chunks with the `/forceload` vanilla command in 1.13 or newer.\nFor older versions, you can search for some mod that force-loads chunks.\n\n**Q**: I found a bug.  \n**A**: Report it [here](https://github.com/VidTu/Ksyxis/issues). If you are not sure if this is a bug, you can join\nthe [Discord](https://discord.gg/Q6saSVSuYQ).\n\n**Q**: It says *Ksyxis: No Mixin found*.  \n**A**: If you're using ancient Forge (1.15.2 or older), you may need to\ninstall [MixinBootstrap](https://modrinth.com/mod/mixinbootstrap), [MixinBooter](https://modrinth.com/mod/mixinbooter),\n[UniMixins](https://modrinth.com/mod/unimixins) **OR** any other at your choice.

adds seasons to the game, dynamically changing biomes as you play.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Ol1Tcf8.png\" width=\"143\" height=\"50\">\n\n</center>\n\n### Description\n\nFabric Seasons adds **four seasons** to Minecraft, each lasting 28 in-game days (configurable). The **current season** is defined by the **world time** (using `/time set 0` will reset to day 1 of spring). Each season has its own changes; during the spring, biomes will mostly try to match their original characteristics.\n\nThe mod has 2 components:\n- **Server:** If installed on the server biomes will have different temperatures. (this enables weather changes like snowing and block freezing in the winter). The server component also contains seasonal crops, allowing crops to grow at different speeds according to the season.\n- **Client:** If installed on the client biomes will have different colormaps according to the current season. This is just a visual change and it'll not physically impact your world in any form.\n\nTo get the full experience it's recommended that you install the mod on both the server and the client.\n\n### Seasonal Biomes\n\nBiomes have **different temperatures** depending on the current **season**:\n\n- Cold Biomes will have rain in the summer\n- Temperate Biomes will have snow in the winter\n- Tropical Biomes will have a steady season all year round\n- Hot Biomes will have a rainy season in the winter\n\nDepending on the **original** temperature/precipitation of the **biome**, this behavior can change. \n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NdYBkgC.gif\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gH5seb5.gif\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Qs600XR.gif\">\n</center>\n\n### Seasonal Crops\n\nCrops will grow at **different speeds** depending on the current **season**.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/75gqPqS.png\">\n</center>\n\nEach **individual crop** will have a **pre-configured** growth **speed** for one of the four seasons, this is controlled by a **datapack** and can be changed by the user if they want.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/dR4OYPT.png\">\n</center>\n\n### Other Information\n\nFor bug reporting please proceed to the mod's GitHub repository: [https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons](https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons)\n\nIf you have any other questions or suggestions, feel free to call me on Discord @D4rk#0693  \nYou can find me in the Cafeteria Development guild.\n\n[![](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/707435077679841350/embed.png?style=banner2&v=2)](https://discord.com/invite/G4PjhEf)","published":"2021-05-09T15:41:27.109292Z","updated":"2023-08-12T09:38:01.813799Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":1214808,"followers":1009,"categories":["adventure","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17-pre1","1.17-rc1","1.17","1.17.1","1.18-rc4","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["LhCaMIzy","jQoWa0il","zQt9Dd2v","McebIuW7","gtoXC9cr","t3cqWJpS","ZSlExvBh","nBxZtduO","k55LHPVG","hNV4laag","UBlv1O6X","JoW6p4c5","tXjlq5P9","SgKuDqln","UYBTrmgB","tjP6OtOn","FWErjNOd","Gil5sfVD","G7yrUl8Y","866aPKAj","k9JfRwVM","3wVgEG0u","7EU0UwXc","rLlocL2I","5yFOnFEL","QlPte8FN","dJtxMqxE","5TNKN9aR","sX1BCX14","hp6m6aJl","uMEzKato"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KJe6y9Eu/7ce47fcb4242493ad069789298400b14f27737ad.png"},"version":{"id":"uMEzKato","project_id":"KJe6y9Eu","author_id":"TPRVvJKm","featured":false,"name":"Fabric Seasons 2.3","version_number":"2.3+1.20","changelog":"A changelog can be found at https://github.com/lucaargolo/fabric-seasons/commits/","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-12T09:38:04.242253Z","downloads":745648,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"ad7a86f9bf9d2fed80b186422ab5e73bf235f4f8","sha512":"6ec4ca16e70fa95adb516ed984f1da4c009710ee43941b36cb9f441b42d6772de7f9a9c74909d10657b51d8b2a4d158917b7112a2094729949cccf7b8f169e21"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KJe6y9Eu/versions/uMEzKato/fabric-seasons-2.3%2B1.20.jar","filename":"fabric-seasons-2.3+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":428398,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"qABOlhS9","user":{"id":"TPRVvJKm","username":"D4rkness_King","name":"Luca Argolo","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/TPRVvJKm/icon.png","bio":"","created":"2020-12-01T01:52:35.107689Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"fabric-seasons-2.3+1.20.jar"},"mods\\Terralith_1.20.x_v2.5.4.jar":{"sha512":"885e171d8b34aae7e142f082d0364285ec5a8e8342f11c60d341f7a94083d5a42c4e30612fe4f9f64d57b484396a3dff3a224e2a2497d4ced8d22f2ad6cd561d","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"8oi3bsk5","slug":"terralith","project_type":"mod","team":"L2q5L80c","title":"Terralith","description":"Explore almost 100 new biomes consisting of both realism and light fantasy, using just Vanilla blocks.

There are also new terrain types: canyons, shattered biomes, floating islands, deep ocean trenches, and much, much more.\n\n**Yellowstone** is one of Terralith's staple biomes - a simple and beautiful landscape, based on the real life US National Park. Among the list of realistic biomes are **Yosemite Cliffs**, **Shield**, and many more depending on what you're looking for in a biome. **Highlands** and its variants offer a flat surface to create on - builders can imagine anything from huge mega cities to small simple cottages. Adventurers can explore the breath-taking **Volcanic Peaks** and discover the beautiful **Desert Oases**.\n\nWhile realistic biomes can remind us of the beautiful planet we live on, Terralith offers a plunge into the world of fantasy as well. Adventurers can wander through the purple and mystical **Moonlight Grove** and **Amethyst Rainforest**, or climb the unforgiving cliffs of the **Scarlet Mountains**. If determined, sailers can find the mysterious **Mirage Isles**, or even the elusive and nostalgic **Alpha Islands**. Terralith encourages imagination to run wild here.\n\nIf you feel the surface is too face, have no fear - custom caves lurk beneath your feet! Similar to Minecraft's Lush Cave, the **Underground Jungle** is full of foliage, and rarely some old abandoned houses. Other caves, like **Infested** and **Fungal Caves** are overgrown with spiders and fungi! If you dig super deep, you could stumble upon a sister to the Deep Dark: the **Frostfire Caves** are dangerous and menacing. Beware!\n\n### Structures\nTo tie all of Terralith's magnificent biomes together are it's structures. The ominous tall **Spire** pierces the sky in the iciest biomes. Rarely, you can find **Fortified Villages** in the plains and desert - the villagers have progressed quite far as a society! Finally, if you find yourself lost at night, cold and hungry, you might stumble into the warm protection of the simple Glacial Hut.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","published":"2022-11-13T21:48:54.507121Z","updated":"2024-07-07T22:16:46.219799Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":1589903,"followers":2159,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["Q9qUUqA7","Wd3Co0mZ","81tshMIZ","Xf5mFGCS","jUK1mCz3","1latp88m","pNFzTzQd","mLdNNka6","K3S6BASh","aYOzrVFZ","Y4i2gvLB","D0hKeWDQ","JT2esX5R","8N8lLvTW","34PhE3zd","2w1uZoRC","PNByHzei","WZvndtxX","UJtMNPNx","Rq2BBA8A","hYoo0DKV","CDrDiFNK","qFd4s3fV","FOe2l0tx","IWVbiEbl","1hOeraaL","4KrRTVvQ","WgDuoe1K","xm11wemG","FgvUosFH","zA1qYB0L","6DoFR4md","owDSctxm","rWmFwtGy","IA4tbVrS","5k90Bexh","WeYhEb5d","Mm6TmSwo"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/34c751cc804839ed3c1d9f21dfd53d98368fedfc.png"},"version":{"id":"WeYhEb5d","project_id":"8oi3bsk5","author_id":"oRXQvVNJ","featured":true,"name":"v2.5.4 ~ 1.20.x","version_number":"2.5.4","changelog":"# 2.5.4\n- Fixed uncommon crash regarding features in Thermal Caves\n- Fixed annoying (but harmless) console spam regarding Biome Tag Villagers\n- Armadillos correctly spawn in Savannas and Savanna Plateaus\n- Striped and Spotted wolf variants now spawn in all Vanilla and Terralith biomes that they're meant to\n- Barrels inside the Terralith Witch Hut have a new loot table\n- Fixed issue where some suspicious gravel/sand in a few of the large Rubble structures were missing loot tables\n- Fixed missing fisherman loot table in Desert Fortified Village\n- The book in the lectern in the Desert Outpost is now readable and doesn't glitch out\n# 2.5.3\n(Terralith 1.21 got this update, but was skipped for 1.20.x until now)\n- Fixed issue where some Sea Pickles were not properly waterlogged","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-07-07T22:15:51.167522Z","downloads":75328,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"79e1409b8db4ce86df9d6d6730f09c4bd8860a30","sha512":"885e171d8b34aae7e142f082d0364285ec5a8e8342f11c60d341f7a94083d5a42c4e30612fe4f9f64d57b484396a3dff3a224e2a2497d4ced8d22f2ad6cd561d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/versions/WeYhEb5d/Terralith_1.20.x_v2.5.4.jar","filename":"Terralith_1.20.x_v2.5.4.jar","primary":true,"size":3156901,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"]},"members":[],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Terralith_1.20.x_v2.5.4.jar"},"mods\\cloth-config-11.1.118-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"848aeaf9c218e39452a2efced1872c2f7275c8fd2504fc2cbd63b159faf4eed96481144b7e1dc4fa27296727f54803907ae2e477e66a803c07a2fd51f831eb07","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"9s6osm5g","slug":"cloth-config","project_type":"mod","team":"z9omIQMN","title":"Cloth Config API","description":"Configuration Library for Minecraft Mods","body":"[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZEORx0F.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\"/>](https://discord.gg/Vs9AVkxjYY) [<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LrVLC2a.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"201\"/>](https://www.patreon.com/shedaniel)\n\nCloth Config API is a config screen api.\n\n### Developers Wiki\n[https://shedaniel.gitbook.io/cloth-config/](https://shedaniel.gitbook.io/cloth-config/)\n\nNeed a server to play with friends?

Hopefully this will encourage you to farm a little bit of everything!\n\n### **IMPORTANT, BREAKING CHANGES on _1.2.0(MC1.18.2)_ and _1.3.1(MC1.19)_**\n> **This update is a major upgrade, I recommend that you make a backup of your world before updating to this version, because this version modifies identifiers of entities, blocks and items for pantries that have been renamed to cabinet. The mod will try to migrate, but will delete all pantries placed in inventory and world if it does not succeed to migrate.**\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**Follow the advancements!** Much of its progression is described through them. By default, press the (L) key to open the Advancements screen.\n\nIf you'd rather get a more straight-forward guide, we wrote a *__[Getting Started](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started)__* to help you learn the basics!\n\n\n## Beta Version\n\nThis mod is currently **under development**, so issues and instabilities may occur. If you'd like to play, keep in mind:\n* **Backup your saves often**;\n* Make sure everything is working before adding it to a modpack;\n* Report any issues you find to our **[issue tracker](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues)**! It helps us a lot!\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n***Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?***\n> Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n> * Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n> * Remember that this mod is in beta, so keep and eye out for major gameplay changes and additions that may happen between versions.\n\n***Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?***\n> Farmer's Delight will always keep up with the latest version of Minecraft, with temporary support for the previous one. As of now:\n> * The current focus is exclusively on version(s) : 1.19 and 1.18.2;\n> * This mod port will never be backported to any version prior to 1.16.5 (please don't ask further);\n\n***Q. Do you have a Patreon, or similar means of supporting your work?***\n> Not currently, but thanks for your consideration!

up your own Vinery.</center>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n \n \n__Features__\n<br>\n- A new crafting system for making wine \n- Multiple variants of wine which will affect you differently (in a positive way - were still in minecraft :))\n- New bushes and trees \n- Lots of decorative blocks \n- Slabs! Dirt, coarse dirt and grass slabs\n- Finally a flower pot thats big enough so you can place tall flowers in it \n- Collect a new armor set and make use of its unique set bonus\n- A new type of wood\n- New villager profession and a new wandering trader \n<br>\n… and more\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n\n__Getting started__\n<br>\n<br>\nYou'll need to find grapevine bushes to gather your first Grapes. If you cant find any a Wandering Winemaker will make visit from time to time maybe offering some seeds. You can get seeds by eating Grapes.\nAfter harvesting your first Grapes can either just eat them or put them into a Pot and crush them by jumping and walking around in it. Then you can extract Grapejuice by using Empty Winebottles. Filled Winebottles can be refined in a Barrel by using extra Ingredients such as Sweetberries, Honey and so on. Different sort of Grapejuice and Ingredients result in different Wine. \n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\nThere are actually 4 different varieties of Grapes available: \nLight, Heavy, vigorous and resilient. Each of them are found in different biomes and will affect your wines different. For example: You can find resilient Grapes mostly in Jungle Biomes and you can craft mostly Wines with the ability to heal with it. Heavy Grapes are found in cold Biomes; such as Taiga or Old Growth Pine Forests. Most Wines crafted with heavy Grapes will give you the ability to increase your Protection. \nHaving troubles finding Grapes or Seeds?

If disabled it's reversed, and only works when sneaking.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>automaticallyFindBottomBlock</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): Whether the mod should attempt to find the actual bottom log of the tree and start there. This means you can break a tree in the middle and it will still completely be felled.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>enableFastLeafDecay</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, the leaves around a broken tree will quickly disappear.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>enableNetherTrees</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, the warped stem/crimson trees in the nether will also be chopped down quickly.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>enableHugeMushrooms</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, giant/huge mushrooms will also be chopped down quickly.<br><strong>ignorePlayerMadeTrees</strong> (default = true): If enabled, trees with leaves placed by players won't be destroyed.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>replaceSaplingOnTreeHarvest</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, automatically replaces the sapling from the drops when a tree is harvested.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>replaceMushroomOnMushroomHarvest</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, automatically replaces the sapling from the drops when a huge mushroom is harvested and 'enableHugeMushrooms' is enabled.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>loseDurabilityPerHarvestedLog</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, for every log harvested, the axe held loses durability.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>loseDurabilityModifier</strong>&nbsp;(default = 1.0, min 0.001, max 1.0): Here you can set how much durability chopping down a tree should take from the axe. For example if set to 0.1, this means that every 10 logs take 1 durability.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>increaseExhaustionPerHarvestedLog</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): If enabled, players' exhaustion level increases 0.005 per harvested log (Minecraft's default per broken block) * increaseExhaustionModifier.</span><br><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><strong>increaseExhaustionModifier</strong>&nbsp;(default = 1.0, min 0.001, max 1.0): This determines how much exhaustion should be added to the player per harvested log.

In Herbal Brews, it's all about tea and brewing: lavender tea, black tea, green tea, as well as coffee and potions, along with vials of long-lasting strengthening effects.</center>\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<center>\nGetting started:\n\nVarious new plants and flowers can be found in the world: hibiscus, lavender, coffee plants, as well as various exotic variations of tea plants.\n <br>\nTea leaves can be collected by shearing flowers. These can then be either cultivated as tea plants or dried. Combine 9 tea leaves and place the block outside.\n <br>\nTo process dried tea, you have two different tea kettles available: copper and iron, both of which only differ aesthetically. Place the kettle on a furnace, add all the required ingredients, wait a moment, and enjoy your tea!<br>\nMost teas have effects that positively impact all players within a certain radius.\n <br>\nThere is also the option to create potions.

It was designed for modpack creators to remove undesired entities that may unbalance the game or\n\ncreate issues.\n\n \n\n- Can I still make the entities spawn?\nNo, once a mob is added to the blacklist, there is no way to spawn it by any method.\n\nBoth natural or through eggs/commands. This mod is meant to completely remove undesired entities\n\n \n\n- Client or server?\nEverything happens on the server's side. Though it is recommended to leave the mod and config for clients too,\n\nfor the case they want to play a single player world. You should always leave this mod in the server pack alongisde its config.\n\n \n\n- What if I add an entity to blacklist that was already spawned?\nSpawned entities will still exist, so it's up to you if you want to kill them or not.\n\nFor this reason it's recommended to configure the mod before creating a world \n\n \n\n- What if I mispell an entitity's ID in the config file?\nNothing will happen. Adding invalid ID's won't cause issues, but obviously the entity won't be blacklisted\n\nas it technically doesn't exist. Same thing would happen if the mod isn't present, but it will be if it's added later and the ID is valid.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nExample Configuration:\n\nConfiguration is as simple as adding JSON entries for each entity you want to prevent from spawning.\n\nEntities can be from vanilla or any mod, you just have to add the id with the proper namespace, like minecraft:slime\n\nIt's located inside the config folder, with the file \"ysns.json\"","published":"2023-04-27T01:27:39.960103Z","updated":"2024-06-13T16:36:12.104429Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":361073,"followers":83,"categories":["management","mobs","utility"],"additional_categories":["optimization"],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["sRUWI3ip","BqJVrHr1","iqO3BQiY","zchsw4Z8","So46vAEN","a2waJ4uL"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/EjXcpmEA/dd9dcfd02df9dd385be8ce1a99b5dc9e9b33aae5.png"},"version":{"id":"So46vAEN","project_id":"EjXcpmEA","author_id":"Kp5oK4eX","featured":true,"name":"You Shall Not Spawn! 1.0.5","version_number":"1.0.5","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-23T07:27:01.802236Z","downloads":264219,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"fa375e687e617c6efbc2b7791eeaacf418d8a456","sha512":"2a18943f954c5ad024c614cdf227f995df447b962ed91745af70362b85ea8d89bc4c537d628812e9c26788d5df0a335c505b50d484979e1ba9351478ceeb1598"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/EjXcpmEA/versions/So46vAEN/YSNS-Fabric_Quilt-1.0.5.jar","filename":"YSNS-Fabric_Quilt-1.0.5.jar","primary":true,"size":7805,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"K9MP0gCT","user":{"id":"Kp5oK4eX","username":"ElocinDev","name":"Nicole","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Kp5oK4eX/e5c22c1a3b936e38de559ce58eec20f6a766470b.png","bio":"Mod developer working @ Luna Pixel Studios","created":"2022-11-10T10:48:24.447467Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"K9MP0gCT","user":{"id":"GpOHZG9G","username":"LunaPixelStudios","name":"Luna Pixel Studios","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135580893?v=4","bio":"https://discord.gg/LunaPixel","created":"2023-06-05T06:00:30.865746Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Studio","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"YSNS-Fabric_Quilt-1.0.5.jar"},"mods\\watut-fabric-1.20.1-1.1.1.jar":{"sha512":"7603c7624e250e20f935548ee694768eb1224bd9d9738c15299c20ea024378a1d92a1aed3e19f4d4e5b3dfb706a7cfd2e4ca9bc394cab5d36531dfc6f8fc3b5d","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"AtB5mHky","slug":"what-are-they-up-to","project_type":"mod","team":"A84mUMft","title":"What Are They Up To (Watut)","description":"Lets you see if players are typing, in a GUI, idle, with cool ingame visuals","body":"# Features:\n\n\n## See when they're typing, in world and in GUI, the visual gets faster and wackier the faster you type!:\n\n![typing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Corosauce/WATUT/43929914de316ac05ed1844927a83db457633ad4/showcase/typing.gif) ![typing_gui](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Corosauce/WATUT/43929914de316ac05ed1844927a83db457633ad4/showcase/typing_gui.gif)\n\n\n\n## See when they're In a GUI such as inventory, chest, crafting, etc, shows their hand moving and clicking around at a screen in front of them\n\n![in_inventory](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Corosauce/WATUT/43929914de316ac05ed1844927a83db457633ad4/showcase/in_inventory.gif)\n\n## See when they're Idle for over 5 minutes.

Each fortress is comprised of three parts — the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces. Note that this is an optional feature — Create is not required to run this mod. Be sure to use the latest release of Create for your Minecraft version!

It also adds a few more Animals. The goal was to make the world feel wilder, overgrown, and more alive. </center>\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### Features\n### \n* Overhauls all Biomes except Badlands, Mushroom Islands, and Deserts.\n* The Old Growth Birch Forest has been replaced by an Aspen Forest.\n* The Old Growth Pine Taiga has been replaced by a Larch Forest.\n* 26 new flowers such as Bluebells, Foxgloves, and many more.\n* New animals! Bisons, Turkeys, Deers, and more.\n* New stone variants: Laterite and Travertine. You can now craft Mushroom Bricks.\n* New blocks such as Quicksand, Marsh Blocks, and Forest Moss.\n* Lots of new wood sets. If you're familiar with other [Let's Do] Mods, you'll remember these wood colors well. All of them come with unique windows.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n###  Notable Changes\n### \n* Chickens have been removed from Forest, Savanna, and Jungle Biomes. Turkeys now spawn in the forest as a replacement.\n* Cows have been removed from Forest Biomes, Savanna, and Jungle Biomes. Bisons now spawn in the savanna as a replacement.\n* Pigs have been removed from Forest Biomes, Savanna, and Jungle Biomes. Boars now spawn in the savanna and forest as a replacement.\n* Vindicators and Pillagers have a small chance to spawn in Dark Forests.\n* Now, the universally disliked beachparty pelicans can be found here.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<center>\nBloomingNature only changes Vanilla features by removing and/or replacing them. It doesn't alter how the world generates or the biome placement.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nApart from the farm animal replacements, the new animals don't drop anything special. Their purpose is simply to make the world more immersive and exciting.\n</center>\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### Where do i find...  \n### \n\n<br>\n\n**...

Termites have a small chance of spawning nearby Termite Mounds in Savannas.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\nTested for compatibility and confirmed to work with the following Worldgen Mods:\n* Terralith \n* Meadow\n* Beachparty\n* Natures Spirit \n* Regions Unexplored \n* Reterraforged\n* William Wythers Expanded Ecosphere \n* William Wythers Overhauled Overworld \n* Continents \n* BiomeMakeover\n* Ecologics \n* Naturalist\n* Spawn\n* Good Ending\n  \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n_<center>BloomingNature is not intended to be realistic or adhere to the real world in terms of the presentation of biomes or the occurrence of plants, even though the biomes may be inspired by certain regions.</center>_\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\nPlease Note: BloomingNature wont be available for forge - don't ask for it.

mods.</p>\n<p><b>For all my mod devs out there - </b>This provides a lot of useful stuff, especially if you're a worldgen modder!</p>\n<p>The API includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AutoRegistration system (1.18+ only). Register any field with only a simple annotation, regardless of mod loader!</li>\n<li>Custom reimplementation of Jigsaw Manager with improved performance and custom pool element types with various new properties. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/yungnickyoung/YUNGs-Better-Dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Dungeons code</a> to see it in action.</li>\n<li>New criteria trigger for safely locating any structure. If the given structure doesn't exist, the trigger simply fails rather than instantly passing (unlike vanilla).</li>\n<li>Interfaces for JSON serialization &amp; deserialization&nbsp;with built-in type adapters.</li>\n<li>Simple, lightweight math utilities for vectors and column positions</li>\n<li><em>BlockStateRandomizer</em> and <em>ItemRandomizer</em>, data abstractions that make adding block and item randomization to your structures incredibly simple. I use these for all of my mods!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're curious, you can check the code for my mods (especially the newer ones) to see how things work.

Brau Bier, beiss in a Bretzn – willkomme zum Braufescht!\n</center>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n \n \n__Key Features__\n<br>\n* Drying, brewing, drinking!\n* Brew your own Beer\n* ... or brew your own Whiskey!\n* Visit the Brew Festival and get yourself some beautiful attire! Lederhosen, shirts, Dirndl\n* New Building Blocks, new Food Blocks, new decorative Elements - All in the Style of the Oktoberfest\n<br>\n… and more\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n\n__Getting started__\n<br>\n<br>\n__Drying__\nOne of the basic ingredients for beer and whiskey is dried corn, wheat, or barley. To obtain this, you need a drying silo. Gather the corn, wheat, or barley, open the hatch of the silo with a skillful left-click (you need both hands for this! So make sure they are both empty!) and throw it into the silo. The silo connects in a 2x2 or 3x3 grid and can be extended up to a maximum height of 9. The larger the silo, the greater the capacity and the faster the drying\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n__Brewing__\nGreat job with the drying! Next up is the Brewing Station. To start the brewing process, you still need more ingredients. In most cases, hops, water, and coal. What? Coal in beer? No, no - it serves a different purpose. Let's take a normal wheat beer as an example: Throw two sacks of dried wheat and some hops into the brew kettle, fill it with water, and you're almost there. You've probably already noticed that the brew kettle is a bit larger and consists of several parts - now go to the part with the stove and fire it up with the coal. That's it!\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n__Brewing Process__\nThe brewing process lasts several seconds and requires your attention. Several small events occur at different parts of the Brewing Station, such as:\nThe furnace loses heat and requires more coal\nThe brewing kettle overheats; remove some water\n... and more to figure out \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n__Hops?__\nHops can be found in Taigas. Yes - even in those from [insert any Worldgen Mod that uses the #is_taiga tag here]. To grow hops, you need a somewhat elaborate construction: Build two fence posts with a height of three blocks (or more - higher is always better!) and connect them with a rope. Then you can plant the hops at the lowest point of the rope on farmland. Of course, you can also use the ropes for other things: fences, railings - let your creativity run wild! :)\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n__Hops?__\nHops can be found in Taigas.

Of course, you can also use the ropes for other things: fences, railings - let your creativity run wild! :)\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n__Where can I get these alluring lederhosen?__\nI'm asking for a friend, of course. The armor pieces are sold by villagers. You can either find them at the Brew Festival or you can provide them with a Bar Counter to work at. One part of the armor set cannot be purchased and must be obtained in another way - but I'll leave it to you to figure that out.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nFeeling lost?

If one does not, feel free to report it.\n\n## Features\n\n#### Optimizations\n\nA lot of the optimizations in this mod are focused on getting rid of the majority of random lagspikes on servers.\\\nOther than that, it also includes plenty of optimizations for things like chunk ticking, mob spawning, item frames and\nplayer logins.\n\n___\n#### Entity Activation Range\n\nA very configurable feature that allows you to drastically cut down on the amount of entities that have to be processed\non the server.\\\nThis is a port based off of Spigot's and PaperMC's implementation, but more configurable with additional (optional) features.\n\n___\n\n#### Dynamic performance checks\n\nAllows the server to automatically adjust the current settings depending on the tick time and config.\\\nThese include: Chunk-tick distance, View distance, Simulation distance & Mobcaps.\n\n___\n\n#### Villager lobotomization\n\nAllows the server to cut down on villager lag from large trading halls, by making villagers stuck inside 1x1 spaces tick less often.\n\n___\n\n#### More configurable mobspawning\n\nAllows you to modify the spawnrate and mobcaps of each individual spawngroup.\nIt also provides optional functionality to force mobcaps to apply to zombie reinforcements, spawners and nether portal randomticks.\n\n___\n\n#### Breeding Caps\n\nA feature that allows you to set a cap on the amount of mobs of the same type that can be bred within a certain radius.\\\nThis can be useful to prevent players from breeding thousands of animals like chickens or cows in a small area.\n\n___\n\n#### Chunk ticking distance\n\nA setting that allows you to reduce the distance at which chunks can tick (mob spawns & random ticks).\n\\\n\\\n**- And more!**\n\n## Commands, Placeholders and Configuration\n\n### Commands\n\n- /servercore reload - Reloads the configuration file.\n\n- /servercore settings - Allows for modifying dynamic settings ingame.\n\n- /servercore status - Gives information about the current dynamic settings.\n\n- /mobcaps - Displays current per-player mobcaps for each spawn group.\n\n- /statistics entities | block-entities - Displays performance related statistics.\n\n### Placeholders\n\n- `%servercore:view_distance%` - The current view distance.\n- `%servercore:simulation_distance%` - The current simulation distance.\n- `%servercore:chunk_tick_distance%` - The current chunk tick distance.\n- `%servercore:mobcap_percentage%` - The global mobcap percentage that is currently being used.\n\n\n- `%servercore:chunk_count%` - The amount of chunks on the server (doesn't have to be fully loaded).\n- `%servercore:chunk_count loaded%` - The amount of fully loaded chunks on the server (expensive).\n\n\n- `%servercore:entity_count%` - The amount of loaded entities on the server.\n- `%servercore:entity_count nearby%` - The amount of loaded entities nearby.\n\n\n- `%servercore:block_entity_count%` - The amount of ticking block entities on the server.\n- `%servercore:block_entity_count nearby%` - The amount of ticking block entities nearby.\n\n### Config\n\nBy default, ServerCore will disable most of its changes that can affect vanilla behavior.\\\nThis way you can safely install the mod without having to worry about breaking things.\n\nHowever, if you want to squeeze out the most performance, these default settings might not be enough.\\\nTo change these settings you can edit `config.yml` and `optimizations.yml` in the `config/servercore` folder.\n\nYou can find some example configurations [here](https://github.com/Wesley1808/ServerCore/tree/v1.5.0/docs/config).\n\n## License\n\nServerCore contains several ports based on patches from repositories such as PaperMC, Purpur and Airplane.\\\nIf a file uses the GPL-3.0 license it will be stated at the top.

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open

Do] Meadow","description":"A Mod offering a slight overhaul for the meadow biome by adding two new sub biomes and introducing the process of crafting cheese.","body":" ![Logo](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/657/498/meadow.png)\n\n\n\nHello and welcome to Meadow! Meadow is a mid sized Minecraft Mod which focuses on improving and overhauling the already existing Meadow Biome. It also expands the variety of animals by adding the almost lost ones from Minecraft:Earth. \n\nTo get some energy for exploring the new Biome you should definitely take some Cheese with you - crafting cheese is another feature Meadow brings. Oh - and consider bringing a weapon; we heard some aggressive Brown Bears walking around there.\n\n\n\n \n__Features__\n* A new crafting system for Cheese\n* The Meadow Biome got completely overhauled. It features now some smaller building, a forest area, clearing and vegetation\n* New Animal-Breeds for Cows, Cattles, Chickens, Bears and Sheeps…\n* With new Sheeps and Cattles theres also new Wool, Carpets and Beds \n* You can now get Milk from Goats, Sheeps, Buffalos… Wont spoil to much!\n* Lots of decorative blocks \n* New Armor\n* A few new paintings featuring some popular places in switzerland \n* Tired of farming bricks for flower pots? You can craft now wooden flower pots. Coming in 2 different sizes. \n* A new type of wood\n* A new type of stone\n* A lot of new flowers!\n* Lots of technical Blocks which will help you saving resources and time just like a Woodcutter\n \n \n\n__How to craft Cheese?__\nTo craft Cheese you will need following Ingredients: Salt, Rennet and Milk. You can find Alpine Salt everywhere underground in the new Meadow Biomes. Rennet can be extracted from Raw Beef, using a cooking pot and Salt. Different Milk will result in different Cheese. \n \n \n\n__Where do i find all these new Type of Sheeps?__\nFlecked and Patched Sheeps can be found nearly everywhere where a regular Sheep will spawn too. Fuzzy Sheeps can mostly be found in Dark Forest or Birch Forest Biomes. Horned Sheeps do like cold biomes: If there is snow your chance finding a Horned Sheep will be certainly higher. Rocky Sheeps therefore can be found on rough terrain biomes. Inky Sheeps can be found in meadow biomes such as Long Nosed Sheeps. \n \n\n\n__And what about Cows?__\nYou can find Highland Cattles and Dairy Cows in the Meadow Biome. Sunset and Cream Cows as well as Buffalos can mostly be found in warm biomes such as the Savanna, Savanna Plateau. If you're looking especially for Buffalos just keep an eye on water resources. Cookie and Umbra Cows can be found in Forests and all the other Cows do share Spawn Locations with Vanilla Cows. \nAnything special about these cows? Buffalo Milk can only be optained from Buffalos. Umbra and Highland Cattles can be sheared.\n \n\n\n\n \nMeadow should be compatible with most WorldGen Mods such as WiliamWythersOverhauledOverworld or Terralith. Since all of Meadows Leaves do have a „bushy“ Model it wont work with fast leaves - better turn it off in the option settings. \n \n \n\n  \n \nDedicated to MissLilitu","published":"2023-03-05T09:52:04.270634Z","updated":"2024-07-26T07:53:29.081817Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":308208,"followers":303,"categories":["decoration","food","mobs"],"additional_categories":["equipment","game-mechanics","utility","worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["F6B5mfRf","pzwIWuWk","4fXhdDoQ","WkhBbeX5","LzYs6y96","CkvEEK6t","s9fp3dqT","M5z80GON","RvotVuwM","7OLeMPXR","Lczsh0Tb","syG35Dbz","QHqnFZCQ","s6iyZ11j","qc3u5IYp","B40ZoBd3","gYJpMo0X","aXV0hfvS","Pu0t9Z0M","uC0K8G0t","OmVA6sCj","XL2U0NKa","v1hn114Z","Y9yHNxAC","Nt1llZAE","Gy9GZdeb","6oiSzkVl","RLVanW9D","m81jLF8f","miNXaly0","iMeun2EO","23ZVhkqv","zSqFSECe","utdA1qC8","jLvkPR0R","ocw1sdZn","ZRcG1Qlu","18qqlnfw","GtlTsR51","LQ0bjhkL","pGx09Lpw","47NDcBIM","bbDfR1Os","O3PNP7F7","B80G8xT0","Qt2lCIS5","UZTOvIXW"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ra7o6Sl7/b26237c7cae39914233fb470328b9d23474dd799.png"},"version":{"id":"Qt2lCIS5","project_id":"ra7o6Sl7","author_id":"u5d114le","featured":false,"name":"[Let's Do] Meadow 1.3.19","version_number":"1.3.19","changelog":"# Meadow 1.3.19 \n* Fixed the \"Find Meadow\" Advancement\n* You can now use Wooden Buckets on a Candlelight Sink","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-07-26T07:53:03.288497Z","downloads":505,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"fc1f2cec6b5210829fb9c4db5324f7b6a633aed44f964e86ae5469e7b3296945386c92b6f7e8c01cb066eaa44dc42c8efcb61c85e2176acaae9809a52ba73baf","sha1":"13350b5784ffc059dc1ce1a117af9939ed05ad3f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ra7o6Sl7/versions/Qt2lCIS5/letsdo-meadow-fabric-1.3.19.jar","filename":"letsdo-meadow-fabric-1.3.19.jar","primary":true,"size":2645493,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"lhGA9TYQ","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"4XJZeZbM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Go8fGgLS","user":{"id":"g7PU4vft","username":"IamJannik","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104758303?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-06-18T14:31:59.745426Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"Go8fGgLS","user":{"id":"3tNWgp1O","username":"Cristelknight","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54945257?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-12-03T10:38:22.510785Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"Go8fGgLS","user":{"id":"u5d114le","username":"satisfyu","name":"mrclb - Marco","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104036234?v=4","bio":"Hey!","created":"2022-12-25T20:25:04.521571Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"letsdo-meadow-fabric-1.3.19.jar"},"mods\\letsdo-beachparty-fabric-1.1.5.jar":{"sha512":"c20b6357e91f27cff8ab865c916c8f750a72fe705fb15097c101b71a45a4b21c8e790c5e3d26a7203b82cbef69039d109f1129b1d2124c3f727b29f0e8df7a1c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"GyKzAh3l","slug":"lets-do-beachparty","project_type":"mod","team":"K6O7q67n","title":"[Let's Do] Beachparty","description":"Get your Suncream out!

A. Q. ❓</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

height=\"59\" /><br />\n<b>An overhaul of the main End Island where the dragon fight takes place!</b>\n<p>Obsidian pillars, End gateways, the spawn platform, and the portal itself in the middle of the island have all been redesigned. Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b> we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b> Also note that <b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again. But once again, back up your world before trying it!

You usually would be forced to restart, even though you didn't really do anything wrong. Maybe\nyour friend didn't do anything wrong either. Overall I believe that death in hardcore is only fun if it feels like you\nreally deserved it, for example while fighting a strong boss monster.\n\nTherefore, this mod aims to solve this problem! When a player dies, instead of being gone for good, they enter a K.O.\nstate, at which point a timer will start running. Being the good friend you are, you can attempt to save them in time.\nIf you do, everything is fine - they get a small debuff and a strong appetite and you two can be on your way again. If\nyou don't, for example because you died while trying to save them, or you just didn't ~~care about your friend~~ get there\nin time, then that's your own fault and you can now decide to restart while in peace with yourself!\n\n<p>\n    <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/balm\"> \n        <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/requires_balm.png\" alt=\"Requires Balm\" width=\"217\" height=\"51\" /> \n    </a>\n    <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/spacer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"21\" height=\"51\" /> \n    <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://discord.gg/VAfZ2Nau6j\">\n        <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/discord.png\" alt=\"Join our Discord\" width=\"51\" height=\"51\" />\n    </a>\n</p>\n\n## Features\n\n- Grace K.O. period before final death where your friends can save you\n- However, friends are not included :(\n- Locate the player and hold-right click to help them get back up\n- K.O. players can look around and chat, but can't move, attack nor use items\n- Works in both Hardcore and Normal mode","published":"2022-06-15T17:49:27.525608Z","updated":"2024-07-01T15:10:48.288039Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":439045,"followers":154,"categories":["adventure","game-mechanics"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["6wGmJftr","NPv6DtMw","EheMzhTn","Pt7Yl10p","crmxpfZM","Bqby8TEs","GTV9aS0F","ppBvqAiy","YneTLY3D","fomv8xij","VlxLLRoO","P1G5MTVn","S2nQZ3pG","rlfjV5SC","jnu2Xa9e","IlAX1bjq","TQPk4LHK","Q7CnwUKz","YF9Vy9lg","YtzcYRw1","emifT1am","cfQtO5gX","sEpTjpTP","juDG23u8","AFe7xCyA","e9UFcTbr","Gx2Drd8l","z3sWddTK","NQEKDc6z","4V3xNV1Q","pVY4RSUV","bZJ8vKa5","N6k2XxPW","j5xUFF7D","OFn8ph2C","LmGHH4vY","SvXynBIj","zJdMZgNZ","dKVlTYX3","PIeuYs6U","nD3YAiGM","mRUR8mWz","WW73W4RX","qmeqPitC","IrCi9pRO","1UAHmiSz"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/HqKoXaXz/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"LmGHH4vY","project_id":"HqKoXaXz","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"12.0.4+fabric-1.20.1","version_number":"12.0.4+fabric-1.20.1","changelog":"- Added disableInSingleplayer and disableInLonelyMultiplayer options to skip the knockout timer in singleplayer or when playing alone on a server\n- Added allowAcceptingFate option (default: true) to remove the Accept your Fate button and force players to wait it out\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-03T19:25:23.112793Z","downloads":5370,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"c0e16a573b7b0d39044a8949485d6ee7161ea4a2","sha512":"bc22351dae5e15238b53ea2370a76f6b77545e4c6dd438752b021da44372f493f1f9cf857583f830804d957ffafe5a30cac32bc6f04307f45d97c7727ae09325"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/HqKoXaXz/versions/LmGHH4vY/hardcorerevival-fabric-1.20.1-12.0.4.jar","filename":"hardcorerevival-fabric-1.20.1-12.0.4.jar","primary":true,"size":219743,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"MBAkmtvl","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"7o4Y1keX","user":{"id":"WE4nCeiO","username":"BlayTheNinth","name":"BlayTheNinth","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1933180?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-02-28T14:04:06.205061Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"hardcorerevival-fabric-1.20.1-12.0.4.jar"},"mods\\emi_loot-0.6.6+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"ee215cef8c3a916d1ee084de1804c343c0167ae20123a03f60185c79fb6480db6c7a949769637eef834c31a0497afe8cffb002ddb739db9bec42bdc7be6ca417","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"qbbO7Jns","slug":"emi-loot","project_type":"mod","team":"A6CuhMKl","title":"EMI Loot","description":"A loot drop (chest, block, entity) plugin for the EMI Recipe and Item viewer.","body":"[![Bisect Hosting Banner](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/85a7141b-76c9-4f0c-bd04-21f4b0d56c4a.webp \"Bisect Hosting Banner\")](https://bisecthosting.com/fzzyhmstrs)\n\n![Emi Loot chest screen](https://i.imgur.com/Jaf6bFD.png)\n\n![Chest screen with lots of drops condensed into lists sorted by percentage, each list displays the items in that percentage category.](https://i.imgur.com/0ew58PW.png)\n\n### EMI Loot\n\nEMI Loot is a plugin for the [EMI Recipe and Item viewer](https://modrinth.com/mod/emi) that displays loot tables for chests, blocks , and mobs.\n\n \n*EMI Loot is in beta!

A Forge port is not planned at this time.*\n\n*All credit goes to EmilyPloszaj for the creation of EMI itself.

Hovering over a certain percentage list will show the possible stacks you can expect to get at that probability.\n- Stack sizes shown represent the average item count you can expect to pull at a time (before factoring in the probability).\n- Block drops have been added. These views show the various drops available, split into different categories based on any particular circumstances needed to get that drop (Silk Touch, Shears, etc).\n- Mob drops have been added. Shows drops available split into categories based on circumstances needed to acquire them (only when a mob is on fire, extra with looting, etc)\n\n\n#### Features to come\n- Implement resource-pack driven system for defining custom conditions and how to parse them.\n- Add in fishing and other gameplay loot\n\n\n","published":"2022-09-25T22:13:18.112945Z","updated":"2024-07-08T16:18:17.891555Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":768574,"followers":253,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["g010jnKd","YvsiPoNW","sMYv0WU4","rEZyE6x3","hME9LTtZ","iiGhUAPe","UoqcWBE6","dsAxQzyr","R27L5Wrs","dDsA0q1m","AnKDZCEA","nkW4UzlO","OeVpkByV","byhOHBwi","pFHgMv8g","FzY7HsGk","WLrmskq7","TM0YFork","h5EhjjmQ","nH2jMxUZ","finLaORs","8VxvWtcW","b7JoJE05","p0Ugm9eu","odt1Mqrz","YZu0lWye","48q801AN","vWadFDyM","ge7Vbplt","9rpAPYB9","Xn48U1HI","Rp2bjZ9t","mPCfosCw","x6vIf3HD","tR4xqoxp","7rjmttb6","7fjkgVEh","GUbMMJRo","91c49w5V","95aOKine","O3uMSDN0","6rFgo1Px","lwhMjJHL","DnmJpY7Z","QmFv0252","F12qyiT2","htztuG2C","bStOmyQ8","l8uqaFoj","Och9ldiP","ZkDaJFMU","VhcPzhEp"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qbbO7Jns/dec44ad1547e774b6fce97a5268f6ff6309ec40a.png"},"version":{"id":"lwhMjJHL","project_id":"qbbO7Jns","author_id":"ANKRvkxl","featured":false,"name":"EMI Loot 0.6.6+1.20.1","version_number":"0.6.6+1.20.1","changelog":"* Update of condition icons, thanks to [gayasslily](https://modrinth.com/user/gayasslily)!\n* Fix thundering/not-thundering condition icons being missing\n* Added `canSend` check to packets\n* Fixed chest loot parsing not reading in chances added via `RandomChanceLootCondition`\n* Added ru_ru lang, thanks to [mpustovoi]https://github.com/mpustovoi)!\n* Fixed loot recipes not updating on datapack reload, thanks to [Abbie5](https://modrinth.com/user/Abbie)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-14T19:44:38.123888Z","downloads":145068,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"1ecb08d3a45f000e835e9214eb6bae282bd8fdb0","sha512":"ee215cef8c3a916d1ee084de1804c343c0167ae20123a03f60185c79fb6480db6c7a949769637eef834c31a0497afe8cffb002ddb739db9bec42bdc7be6ca417"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qbbO7Jns/versions/lwhMjJHL/emi_loot-0.6.6%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"emi_loot-0.6.6+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":363534,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"fRiHVvU7","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"A6CuhMKl","user":{"id":"fjpxz8db","username":"gayasslily","name":"Lily","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/fjpxz8db/8008d5d853889ec78ed06111577a56de684d0044.png","bio":"Creator of the modpack 'Lily's Vanilla OverQuilted'.\n\nI also make textures for stuff.","created":"2022-06-10T14:24:39.516887Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"A6CuhMKl","user":{"id":"ANKRvkxl","username":"fzzyhmstrs","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72876796?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-04-13T21:42:13.876320Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"emi_loot-0.6.6+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\Clumps-fabric-1.20.1-12.0.0.4.jar":{"sha512":"2235d29b1239d5526035bffd547d35fe33b9e737d3e75cd341f6689d9cd834d0a7dc03ed80748772162cd9595ba08e7a0ab51221bc145a8fd979d596c3967544","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Wnxd13zP","slug":"clumps","project_type":"mod","team":"twbRaNO5","title":"Clumps","description":"Clumps XP orbs together to reduce lag","body":"Clumps groups XP orbs together into a single entity to reduce lag when there are many in a small area.
